    <p>This past month I attended our Supply Chain Insights Bootcamp training led by Lora Cecere in Philadelphia and facilitated the first course of a Cross-Company Academy training, End-to-End Supply Chain Orchestration. Throughout the great discussions within these courses, I couldn’t help but notice a general theme – people are forgetting to define (or ask) what supply chain excellence looks like for their companies!</p>
    <p>In both <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/services/training/">trainings</a>, supply chain leaders from various companies all over the world learn about next generation supply chain topics. (Cross-Company Academy is a 7 month online training course, Bootcamp is a 2 day in-person training course.) Both training sessions involve these leaders sharing their thoughts and experiences with each other.</p>
    <p>The End-to-End Supply Chain Orchestration course takes a look at how to align a supply chain from your customers all the way back to your suppliers. The importance of supplier development and risk management, along with corporate social responsibility and governance are emphasized.</p>
    <p>When asked what stage in the end-to-end supply chain process maturity they were in, most people in the course said their companies were good at transactional efficiency, and were currently focused on data sharing, moving to policy development (see Figure 1).</p>

    <p>Quite a few people in the online class were talking about using the implementation of a new ERP system as a catalyst to revamp their supply chain processes. The implementation of a common ERP system seems to often be thought of as a necessary step to be able to have visibility to the supply chain – how much product is being made/shipped and when, how much product is there on hand at any given time, when did certain transactions happen (root cause investigations), etc. This continual effort to be able to have everyone on the same system seems to have a lot of supply chains stuck in the data sharing stage of end-to-end process development.</p>
    <p>I have observed in my career and in the conversations in this training that aside from data visibility, a change in systems (even if that system is not ideal) often forces a hard look at the processes in the supply chain. Within the discussions in the End-to-End Supply Chain Orchestration course, however, Lora warned one of the participants to<strong> first focus on defining supply chain excellence</strong> before using the implementation of a new system to drive process changes. What does it look like if your supply chain is good? What is the business strategy? What supply chain strategy aligns with that business strategy? What specific policies, processes, and metrics in the supply chain would achieve success in this strategy?</p>
    <p>Why are we forgetting to define what supply chain excellence means for the company or specific division, especially in terms of business metrics in financial statements, prior to the revamp of processes and policies? If we are spending an incredible amount of resources to go through all of our processes (as is often the case during an ERP implementation), we should establish the overall strategy and goals for supply chain excellence initially.</p>
    <p>In addition to this conversation within the online training, I was amazed during the Bootcamp training at the number of people in the class who admitted that they had never thought about what supply chain excellence means to their company.</p>
    <p>We had an activity during Bootcamp where we looked at a set of business metrics from financial statement information for various companies to try to compare their supply chains. It was difficult to compare the companies based on these results. Some people thought revenue growth was a sign of a strong supply chain, some thought operating margin was the key metric, and others thought return on invested capital was the only metric needed to evaluate the company. Supply Chain Insights has developed the <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/supply-chain-index/">Supply Chain Index</a>, incorporating a combination of financial metrics (and their trajectories over time) and stock market performance to evaluate and rank supply chains.</p>
    <p>To help visualize the significance of the inputs to the Supply Chain Index, orbit charts can be used to compare two important metrics at a time, and how they move together over the years. For example, inventory turns are plotted with operating margin (see Figure 2). It becomes clear whether the company has a strategy, a definition of supply chain excellence, that they are advancing toward, or whether they have various initiatives each year that move one metric suddenly, and then the next year move the other metric when focus is changed.</p>

    <p>Throughout these trainings, it was quite interesting to hear the dialogues amongst the participants. People realize that they are not alone in the issues in their supply chains. The globalization of companies, speed of technology changes, and growth via acquisitions have made things quite complicated, perhaps distracting us from defining what supply chain excellence means.</p>
