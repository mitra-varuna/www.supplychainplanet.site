    <p>MITâ€™s tuition fee is the largest amount I have ever spent solely on myself. Are there career benefits enough to justify this investment? For sure. But the thing is &#8212; I am not looking at a masterâ€™s education at MIT as an investment in my career. For me, it is a luxury to stretch and train my mind on the sunny beach of human knowledge.<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheMitScmProgramStudentBlog#_msocom_1">[</a></p>
    
    
    
    <p>I am not discounting the education one gets from <em>laborâ€™s rugged school</em>. In the 15 years of my career, almost all of my knowledge has come from being hands-on, and it has played an invaluable role in who I am today. Yet university education offers something more: it puts you in the best seat in the theatre and lets <strong>you</strong> observe the drama. To be able to pause, observe and reflect, without the burden to act immediately is indeed a luxury, one you never get when you are working and in the thick of things. Your professors and classmates are fans of the same drama and offer you a kaleidoscope of their impressions. You will be amazed at how much this enriches you. Indeed, <strong>the quality of minds on the campus has to be the biggest draw of MIT.</strong></p>

    <p>To give you a glimpse of what your day at MIT would look like, here is what I did today: I caught a shuttle from my dorm to the library near my classroom at around 7.30 in the morning. I needed to do pre-reading for my class at 10, which is one of my favorites: it is <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m1b.html#1.261">case-study-based </a>and students are expected to come prepared and talk 90% of the class time. The professor <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheMitScmProgramStudentBlog#_msocom_1">[</a>cleverly guides and channels the discussion and makes sure he brings out all the chief points of the case through us and quotes Tolstoy along the way! At noon, I attended a lecture by a star professor whom MIT recently poached from Harvard <img alt="ðŸ˜Š" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" style="height: 1em;" />. I am not enrolled in this class but some of my classmates are. So I just sneaked in to see what it is. You can do this at MIT easily by writing to teaching assistants in advance. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheMitScmProgramStudentBlog#_msocom_2">[</a>&nbsp;At 2, I met my project advisor, who is the SCM blended program director, and there was a lot of white boarding around the optimization model we are building. At 3, I had a <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=scm.255&amp;style=verbatim">machine learning</a> class where the professor discussed neural networks. My tomorrowâ€™s schedule will look completely different with a different set of classes. Each class is usually 1.5/2 hours long and does not repeat more than twice in the same week.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>After the machine learning class, I was supposed to be done for the day, go to my dorm and finish several pre-readings, assignments, project write-ups, exam preparations, and so on. I wish it was that simple. The campus is buzzing with activities in the evening- some of my classmates are going for swimming, some to a local pub, some have arranged a round table with experts, some are catching a jazz concert in the auditorium[&nbsp;. There are book clubs and movie clubs and what not. There are literally scores of <a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/calendar">events every day</a> on campus and you will find yourself drawn to them, even if it means putting extra efforts in nights and on weekends to catch up with your studies.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>If you are a lifelong learner, then come to MIT. You will
    not regret it. If you are a mid-career professional like me, you owe this
    luxury to yourself and I promise you &#8212; you will return to your job happier
    than from any vacation ever!</p>
