    <p>I had a great job as a training operations manager at Amazon. I helped launch four fulfillment centers in the last year, and still had energy to support more. The hard work translated to a promotion and a top performance rating from my management. My team worked well together. I was thoroughly enjoying the people, the work, and the growth.</p>
    <p>So why did I leave to go to grad school?</p>
    <p>To sum it up in one word – faith. Not in the context of religion, but instead in the context of my future. I was young and hungry for growth. I feared that if I did not act on my intuitions now, that I would slowly drown this flame out. I also worried that I would wake up one day in my forties, full of regret for missing out.</p>
    <p>In the scheme of things, I realized that one to two years is negligible in the span of a career.</p>
    <p>Grad school was exactly what I needed. In exchange for the risk of giving up income for a year, I was thrown into an environment of like-minded peers. We shared the same drive, faced the same fear of not living up to expectations, and pushed each other relentlessly. I was exposed rapidly to concepts and material that I could never have learned on my own. Within a matter of months, I quickly acquired and applied technical skills and programming languages without hesitation. But the value of my time here did not lie in the acquisition of marketable skills.</p>
    <p>Surviving MIT courses with classmates has formed a special bond that I am certain will extend far beyond the classroom. For life, I know that I have a tight group of friends that I can reach out to for help. If I forget how to apply a specific logistics model or write a piece of code, I know I’m covered. If I am ever in need of life advice, I know exactly who to turn to. MIT helped forge my new family.</p>
    <p>There is absolutely no price that can be placed on that.</p>
