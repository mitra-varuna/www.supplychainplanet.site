    <p><strong>Amazon&#8217;s announcement of its acquisition of Whole Foods Market will be a landmark business move that has far reaching effects to the Consumer Chain and the way CPG suppliers go to market.</strong></p>
    <p>There are so many pleasures of life in Austin, Texas. Even though I’ve moved out of the unbelievable growth explosion of Austin proper, living this Texas Hill Country life and being close enough to run into town to see a band on Sixth Street, run the hike and bike trails or check out Circuit of the Americas is pure cool. Amidst the eclectic Austin lifestyle of Tex-Mex, BBQ, Armadillos (the downtown bus, not the animal…although we do have the latter as well!) and ACL Fest is a long-time culture of innovation and creativity.  One such spawn of the “Silicon Hills” boom is Whole Foods Market – an idea that grew from Austin’s very own culture to a retail juggernaut that stands alone for innovation in the grocery retail segment. It is one of the best examples of Austin’s culture now spread throughout the nation.</p>
    <p>Today, I read that Jeff Bezos, himself a cultural icon, has taken out his wallet and plopped down $13.7 billion (with a “B”) for our beloved Whole Foods Market. How about THAT for a shock to the digital transformation of consumer goods and retail?  Jeff can now officially wear a “Keep Austin Weird” shi<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/keep-austin-wierd.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-9674 alignright" height="178" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/keep-austin-wierd-300x168.jpg" width="318" /></a>rt!</p>
    <p>It is an interesting point in time to reflect on how such an acquisition will further change the landscape. Amazon is entering the world of brick and mortar retail in a big way; but then again, what’s new about that for a company that has reinvented shopping?</p>
    <p>Talking about disrupting the supply chain…</p>
    <p>In her acclaimed book “<em>Bricks Matter</em>,” Lora Cecere wrote about the role of supply chains in building market-driven differentiation. She writes, “Today, it is focused on not just building chains but also on the design of agile networks.” Clearly, if this deal goes through, Amazon and Whole Foods will be able to initiate a significant set of changes to the supply chain and could easily redefine several processes and practices that may well impact the way everyone goes to market. I will leave the supply chain specifics to Lora and the other supply chain experts; but I do believe that disruption will alter some of the existing go-to-market processes we deal with every day.</p>
    <p><strong>Hammering the Golden Spike</strong></p>
    <p>In 1869, the golden spike was hammered into the final rail joining the east and west United States after a long and grueling contest between the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroad companies creating the transcontinental railroad.  Before that date, there was a long and difficult communication and transportation between the east and west. Think about the situation we have now where little, if any, real collaboration exists between the sales and marketing organizations who, after all, are after the very same goal – increased consumption of their brands and products.</p>
    <p>Marketing organizations drive the direct-to-consumer marketing with their own promotions, advertising, coupon events and other incentives executed by their knowledge of consumer demand and shopping intentions. This is often real-time data that includes social media analyses, direct online tracking, and even service and support intelligence – altogether driving strong insightful guidance and direction of promotion execution. Sales teams receive direct retail data consisting mainly of point-of-sale, historical trade promotion transactions and supply chain insights that are intended to guide the planning of promotions at the retail channel level.</p>
    <p>Jeff Bezos and his Amazon gurus just may have done the same thing old Leland Stanford did back in 1869 – driving the &#8220;golden spike&#8221; that will force the joining of these two traditionally non-communicative corporate organizations. Amazon’s incredible consumer marketing will no doubt be incorporated into the full go-to-market strategy and execution of Whole Foods Market’s own powerful message and positioning actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Supplier Reactions</strong></p>
    <p>Amazon now s<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Whole-Foods-Market.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9675 alignleft" height="168" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Whole-Foods-Market-300x181.png" width="279" /></a>ells literally tons of grocery products – many of them major brands that do not sell into Whole Foods Market store shelves.  I spoke with the organic cereal category manager of one of the major CPG companies just now who told me that this could go either way for them. “We do have a couple of private label products we sell into [Whole Foods Market]; but now I guess we have to wait and see how this would give us any leverage for our branded products;” she said.  A sales rep for a major personal goods company told me that he was gearing up to present promotion plans to his Whole Foods Market buyer that would consist of dual product promotions for his retail organic branded products that sell into the store now and their more commonly known brands that sell on Amazon. He relished the idea and was already working on his sales deal plan. Then he said, “But I am having some difficulty working with my marketing guys who are driving the [direct-to-consumer] events, because they have no desire to link the products, even though I have shown him how we can both benefit.” He is going to bring his Amazon buyer into the discussion because she already told him that she liked the idea.</p>
    <p>See what I mean?</p>
    <p>This is a potentially landmark deal across many different promotion use cases. The smart CPG supplier is going to do what our sales guy above is doing. I think he represents a lot of brainstorming planning going on this very moment in consumer packaged goods companies all over the world. Amazon will be able to nurture this transition nicely by sharing the incredible consumer shopping data they have amassed over the years with their new brick and mortar partner in Austin, Texas; and at the same time, they will be able to use their shipping and distribution channel and supply chain to improve the overall customer experience.</p>
    <p>We live about 45 minutes from the closest Whole Foods Market; but we get amazon deliveries overnight from the huge central Texas distribution center. Bottom line, I get the benefit of Amazon <em>Prime</em> and a Whole Foods Market menu of products. The CPG suppliers can and should execute a consolidated go-to-market strategy, bridging the marketing team’s expertise at delivering the individual consumer profiles and demand signals with the sales team’s visibility to what is going on at the store floor and on the shelf. This can&#8217;t but have an effect on how the internal marketing and sales organizations work at every consumer products supplier that sells into either of these companies. That would be a very good thing, indeed.</p>
    <p>This is the future of consumer promotion and an excellent definition of how the Consumer Chain will work in the years ahead.</p>
