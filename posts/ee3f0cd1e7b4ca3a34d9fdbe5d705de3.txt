    <p>Before I arrived on campus, I was living in a car society: I
    drove to work, I drove to the grocery store, I drove pretty much everywhere I
    wanted or needed to go.&nbsp; I walked to the
    mailbox, if it wasn’t raining of course.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>So, when you get your long-awaited housing assignment you start to plan your routes.&nbsp; I drew <a href="http:// http://s-p.mit.edu/﻿">Sidney Pacific</a> for a residence hall so I’m 1.1 miles (20 min walk) from where most SCM classes are held, no problem.&nbsp; Winter in Boston is fantastic walking weather (not) so you’ll quickly learn the tradeoffs between layering and dragging said clothing layers around with you all day.&nbsp; You’ll also learn the shortcuts through buildings and even underground tunnels on extreme days.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>There are free buses and <a href="https://web-cert.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/shuttles/">shuttles</a> if you’re soft and have no shame. You’re a full-time student again, a member of academic society that should be able to tread through whatever a New England Mother Nature can throw your way.&nbsp; Plus, in the January <a href="http://web.mit.edu/IAP/">IAP program</a> you’re hopping from early to late and walking to and fro is really your only exercise for many weeks – embrace it.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>When the weekend rolls around, you must
    solve the riddle of grocery getting.&nbsp;
    Back home, I go online and pull into my grocery store’s parking lot. They
    load them up and off I go.&nbsp; Here without
    a car you have fewer options, there is an urban Target store not too far away
    or shuttles that run to Trader Joe’s/Whole Foods on 3 out of 4 weekends from
    the dorms (I guess you go hungry that odd weekend).&nbsp; There are dining halls scattered about campus
    if you are interested in a meal plan.&nbsp; There
    are also kitchens or cooking areas in most of the graduate dormitories.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Most of the other life necessities are available by foot depending where you reside. There is a <a href="https://www.mbta.com/">bus system </a>that’s pretty good to use to and from the airport. Plus, you can always use the ride sharing services as there is no shortage of drivers in the campus area.&nbsp; You’ll get what you need without a car and get used to it. If I can do it, you can do it.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Editor&#8217;s note: There are other transportation options include <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/">BlueBike,</a> <a href="https://www.zipcar.com/">ZipCar</a> and Boston <a href="https://www.mbta.com/schedules/subway">subway</a></p>
