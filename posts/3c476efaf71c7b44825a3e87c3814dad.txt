    <p>After 10 months of hard work, the SCM Class of 2016 officially graduated on June 3, 2016. Families and friends flew in from all over the world to attend the SCM Graduation Cruise and MIT&#8217;s Commencement ceremony, which featured guest speaker Matt Damon.</p>
    <p><span id="more-951"></span></p>
    <p>The weeks leading up to graduation were a busy time, as everyone worked hard to prepare for final exams and complete their theses. The culmination of the thesis projects was undoubtedly Research Fest, an all-day event where we presented our findings and results to thesis sponsors, faculty and alumni.</p>

    <p>The next big event was the annual Supply Chain Management Cruise around Boston Harbor. Executive Director Bruce Arntzen welcomed us soon-to-be graduates and our families, and presented awards for outstanding academic performance and the best theses.</p>
    <p>Finally, on June 3rd we wore our caps and gowns and marched to Killian Court for Commencement. Guest speaker Matt Damon emphasized the importance of &#8220;turning towards the problem&#8221; instead of ignoring it or waiting for someone else to fix it. MIT President Rafael Reif encouraged graduates to make the world a better place, &#8220;a little more like MIT&#8221;. These exhortations resonated deeply with many of the themes of supply chain, including the importance of taking a systems view and thinking beyond narrow silos.</p>

    <p>And with that, our MIT journey concluded. While there were ups and downs and a lot of hard work, including many late nights and occasional all-nighters, most everyone would agree the journey was worth it. There were invaluable lessons, amazing experiences, and best of all, lifelong friends among the SCM family.</p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who made this journey possible. On behalf of the Class of 2016, we officially sign off and hand this blog over to the next class.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcome Class of 2017!</strong></p>
    <p>Your 2016 SCM Editors</p>
