    <p>Recently I left a company after 14 years of service. That’s a long time to be at the same place, and it’s uncommon. I experienced multiple changes in leadership, structure, focus, and strategy. During times of change, I soaked up every scrap of a lesson that I could scrounge. During stable times, I knocked out some of the ideas I had accumulated, those “wish I had the time for this” projects.</p>
    <p>I hired several “generations” of entry- and near entry-level employees and watched them grow in and eventually out of my purview. They took on new and different roles both in and outside the company. I contributed to several projects that have had a lasting impact on the organization. I continued to have a back pocket full of ideas and plans that I was excited to get started on.</p>
    <p>And then it was time to go. An opportunity to work with new technology (who can resist something called Operation <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eating-my-own-dog-food-lora-cecere">Dogfood</a>?), with someone I highly esteem, with a small, nimble, and growing company was too much to resist. A month in, I am relishing the change.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself ready to leave, I have a few tidbits for you to consider:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Two weeks is enough.</strong> I firmly believed and have coached everyone I know to give no more than two weeks’ notice. But when it came to my own resignation, I choked. I thought it was only fair to give my employers as much time to transition as possible, so I gave them three weeks. It was a mistake.</li>
    <li><strong>Carve out some time in between jobs.</strong> I didn’t think I needed it. In hindsight, it would have been an easier transition if I had taken some time to catch my breath between gigs. After 14 years, I had collected some baggage. I didn’t recognize that until after the actual separation.</li>
    <li><strong>Prep work.</strong> For the weeks and months prior to my leaving, I began prepping my coworkers. I stopped volunteering for new projects. I asked more from my staff than usual (probably more than they wanted or thought was fair). In team meetings, I carved out time for topics like managing change, dealing with ambiguity, developing strategic relationships outside our group, and opportunities for professional growth beyond traditional career pathing. Whether they noticed what I was doing or why, I like to believe they appreciated the groundwork that had been laid once the change was in motion.</li>
    <li><strong>On being replaceable.</strong> Many of us say it’s important to be replaceable (the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/replaceable-kevin-alavi?trk=v-feed&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_details_all%3BWK45OvKKH7IJLlfzhKKZ2A%3D%3D">article</a> on the subject from Kevin Alavi seemed to resonate with a lot of people). However, to step out of a position and company that I had given so much of myself to and find that they didn’t seem to skip a beat when I left was a challenge on a personal level. Frankly it is exactly that type of disregard that played a big part in my decision to go, but it was still painful to experience the door actually hitting me on the way out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With my track record, I’ve got another 13 years 11 months before considering a similar transition, and truthfully, I’d be happy to never do it again. Thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loracecere">Lora Cecere</a>, for the opportunity to join your journey!</p>
    <p>I’d love to hear your comments. What worked with your last exit? What didn’t?</p>
