    <p>The old saying, “The best price is the right price” ranks in my book right up there with another old saying, “Thanks for sharing!” Or my daughter’s favorite response to an obvious answer…”Duh.”  And that one drives me crazy enough; but don’t you hate it when someone tells you “It is what it is?”</p>
    <p>What a profound statement.  Who came up with that one…Forrest Gump?</p>
    <p>Well at least making sure your product is priced right IS a profound requirement. To get to what IS the best price has taken on an even higher level of importance in the arena of trade channel promotion and consumer marketing than ever before. The technological innovations of artificial intelligence and cognitive learning have delivered the ability to place a much higher focus on price than we have seen in the existing forms of promotion optimization tools.</p>
    <p>This is top<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Pricing_500.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-9624 alignleft" height="223" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Pricing_500-300x200.jpg" width="335" /></a> of mind for me because I have been engaged in some very interesting vendor technology briefings over the past few weeks and I have seen a much more intense focus on price optimization than I have seen in the past. Recognizing the critical nature of price as one of the primary drivers for trade promotion deal negotiation, a couple of the vendors I have interviewed have devoted more of their R&amp;D to pricing than other tactical activities comprising the trade deals. There are some clever applications of external data used to fuel the modeling and predictive analysis of the most appropriate price for a product promotion.</p>
    <p><strong>BUCKING THE TREND</strong></p>
    <p>For even the more sophisticated trade promotion optimization engines, the determination of the discounted price to be applied in a deal is typically sourced from the historical transactions over the recent past promotions in which the product has been involved. The eventual ROI figure from those previous promotions, along with other factors such as timing, spending level, store or market coverage and other causal data is calculated against the embedded mathematical algorithms to produce the best model. One can argue, as we have done recently, that this may not produce the most trusted and precise model; but the point is that, in these cases, the price is a fixed variable, or perhaps a combination of several fixed variables reflected in the original promotion set used in the optimization calculation.  There is no correlation to a near real-time price impact, so how can that be sufficient?</p>
    <p>Over the past couple of years, I have noticed an increase in requests by manufacturers in several industries, not just consumer packaged goods, to utilize their existing configure, price quote (CPQ) software applications for promotion pricing. As these solutions are more robust and use more immediate or recent data, price optimization can be more effective. Some of those products may be able to accommodate promotion price management in channel marketing or trade funds use cases; but often the idea of using them is analogous to using a shotgun to destroy a wasp nest on your garage door – a bit of an overkill…literally.</p>
    <p>That said, however, the idea has merit. Recently, a major food broker explored that very idea because of the enormous number of principal clients for which they had to configure trade promotion pricing deals. That made some sense on the surface, especially considering the powerful price optimization technology that the CPQ product typically has. But it is not generally a software application designed for promotion marketing interfaces, nor does it easily adapt to retail execution or other tactical activity calculations in the optimization application’s variables. But what it does show is that a more robust capability for price optimization is clearly required.</p>
    <p><strong>WHAT’S NEW?<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Price-management_500.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-9625 alignright" height="219" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Price-management_500-300x200.jpg" width="329" /></a></strong></p>
    <p><em>Price elasticity</em> isn’t. It’s been around for a long time and is still one of the primary methods of measuring your product’s success. What IS, however, in trade promotion, is the need to be more immediate with the pricing variables and causal factors. If you optimize your promotions on pure historical transactions, you miss the market movement – you blow your chances to leverage the current economic impact to price overall and potentially set the price at a level that, no matter what your optimization model shows, fails. What is new is what I have seen in some of the briefings we have held where the trade promotion vendors are beginning to import more robust price optimization technology into their application functionality or, in a couple of unique cases, opted out of the traditional end-to-end trade promotion management solution for a focused price management solution.  They see the market going that direction, and they made an excellent decision.</p>
    <p>The development teams responsible for building the trade promotion optimization engines today have to ask: how can or should I leverage the more immediate impact of market dynamics in our calculations of price optimization to deliver a trustworthy ROI?  Virtually every industry is affected, is it not? If you sell coffee, the commodity pricing is a huge variable that you can totally overlook in your promotion optimization, as an example. But you may not even be in fast moving consumer goods to need near real-time data to ensure that your price negotiations are based on the most accurate model you can build. Oil prices affect shipping costs, almost immediately; and this can hit overnight. The impact of the stock market, a recall, and even the consumer’s hatred of a Super Bowl commercial can have immediate impact on price elasticity.</p>
    <p><strong>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</strong></p>
    <p>In our upcoming trade promotion survey we will belaunching soon, we address some of the important trends in promotion optimization and the impact of price. But I am encouraged to see how a more focused approach to the price factor in predictive modeling of trade fund and channel marketing plans will take the most important promotion tactic and enhance the ability to analyze and apply price optimization. I believe we agree that price IS the most important tactical consideration in a trade promotion deal.  If our goal here is to make sure that the price we predict IS the right figure, then making sure that we have a solid price optimization tool is a no-brainer.</p>
    <p>It IS what it IS, isn’t it?</p>
