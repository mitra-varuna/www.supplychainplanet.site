    <p><strong>You’re hearing it every single day now…<em>Digital Transformation</em>.  If “going digital” implies changing the way things work, then how must digital transformation change the way trade promotion works today? While that may require several volumes, let’s focus on five areas we know must change.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>#1: Failed Promotions<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/FAIL-icon.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9986 alignright" height="150" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/FAIL-icon-300x150.jpg" width="300" /></a></em></strong></p>
    <p>Oh heck, why not just tackle the big one right away?</p>
    <p>Our survey on Revenue and Trade Promotion Management is closing soon; and we will have some pretty strong research to pass along on this topic; but you and I both know it is going to tell us that nearly half of the trade promotions continue to produce less than planned ROI. It matters not what your metric is, you get the same results: too much of our trade spend goes down the drain, doesn’t it? Most domain experts will say that there are <em>many</em> causes for why trade promotions fail; but it really comes down to only one major thing: bad intelligence. As Willie Degel, founder and CEO of Uncle Jack’s Steakhouses and noted Food Network star says, “If you can’t SEE the problem, you can’t FIX the problem!”</p>
    <p>And what you can’t see is the consumer.</p>
    <p>Or at least, what you can’t see is what the consumer is going to do, and when. Predicting the success of trade promotion is what this rush to promotion optimization is all about; but, it’s more about the quality and quantity of the <em><u>data</u></em>. The old “garbage in, garbage out” phrase works well here, because what must change is the ability to SEE and, therefore, accurately PREDICT what the consumer is going to do…<em>en masse</em>.  As we have written in past blogs, point-of-sale (POS) data is a huge piece of that puzzle; but it cannot be the only piece. Demand signals include shopping trends, digital footprints of shopping online or looking at recipes, talking to their neighbors and friends on social media, buying habits, and consumption data. In fact, field sales teams that cannot move from a case/volume forecast model to a consumption forecast model will quickly learn that they can’t see the consumer. That will ultimately lead to a status quo planning process and a continuation of failed promotions.</p>
    <p>Converting big data to usable insights can only really be accomplished through a digital path to purchase and an infusion of that technology and intelligence into the trade promotion planning and execution processes. In fact, being able to see what the promotion is doing in near real-time is the only way to avoid the ultimate pain of a failed promotion. That is where digital technology saves the day.</p>
    <p><strong><em>#2 Out-of-Stock Conditions</em></strong></p>
    <p>Good grief, why can’t we fix this problem? We have taken huge steps to reduce the frequency and volume of OOS situations; but we should make it a thing of the past. Clearly, supply chain management technology has improved greatly with the digital revolution; but the peripheral processes including human interaction continue the possibility of less than full shelves during promotions. As we begin to better link the forecast, order management, shipping, transportation and retail execution, things will continue to improve. That said, we still need the collaborative linkages and alignment that digital technology and internet of things (IoT) can bring to ensure that the inventory and stocking performance of the last 100 feet inside the stores is highly visible and actionable immediately. Further, integration of transportation and logistics data along with manufacturing, S&amp;OP and trade promotion <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/InkedEmpty-Shelf_LI.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9987 alignleft" height="200" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/InkedEmpty-Shelf_LI-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a>planning will increase the efficiency and visibility of collaborative planning and forecasting.</p>
    <p>Thinking of the future, here is where IoT can begin to play a major role. Sensors on shelves, both on the shopping floor and in the stock rooms, distribution centers and within the transport trucks and vehicles bring even higher levels of visibility. What about Clientelling tools for the floor sales associates where they can not only track the promotion in real time; but also check online footprints of their shoppers?</p>
    <p><strong><em>#3 Deductions</em></strong></p>
    <p>In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, manufacturers were so overwhelmed with trade promotion claims that the average settlement took longer than 90 days. Retailers began deducting to protect cash flow and it became the settlement standard for CPG. But even with the advanced technologies in financial services, ERP and order management, the deduction continues to plague the industry because most deductions taken are not clearly identified or aligned with a specific promotion plan. The time in human labor and cashflow researching and identifying what these deductions are cost both the retailer and the manufacturer significantly. We have the opportunity to end the problem immediately. Most deductions are caused from errors in the order management process – either those on the retailer’s end placing the orders or on the manufacturer side with order processing, invoicing and shipping. For instance, there are so many deals where the price is impacted that the internal systems, EDI and other processes often default to the standard pricing or other terms, causing the invoice to be different from the order.</p>
    <p>Bang…deduction!  And we’re off to the races to identify the source and promotion involved.<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Price-management.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9988 alignright" height="200" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Price-management-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>
    <p>SAP Ariba has developed a solution that enables close collaboration between buyer and seller parties that goes a long way to eliminate mistakes in the order management process. The SAP <em>Collaborative Supply Chain</em> solution provides a collaboration portal on the Ariba platform where any change to an order is immediately visible and automatically updates the order entry, invoicing and shipping instructions. Order and invoicing errors are a leading cause of deductions, so this is a great example of how a digital solution can eliminate errors that cause so many deductions now.</p>
    <p><strong><em>#4 Consumer Stealth</em></strong></p>
    <p>As far as trade spending is concerned, the role that consumers play has been somewhat muted. Most sales organizations plan on a case volume forecasting model which emphasizes pushing case volume into the store and focus on previous trade promotion performance transactions to drive anticipated ROI. The retailers present scenarios that support the category growth; but the margin value of the trade funds committed often takes priority. The consumer is not as much of a driver in either case. Don’t get me wrong here, I realize that <em><u>every</u></em> category buyer and sales rep will say that they are keenly aware of the consumer; and generally, even if they wanted to, there is little in the way of real intelligence that is both usable and available to integrate into the forecast plan. Consumption forecast planning is making headway; and the good news is that this is the right foundation for adding the <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Consumer-Stealth.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9989 alignleft" height="200" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Consumer-Stealth-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a>consumer intelligence through advanced technology and big data.</p>
    <p>An extremely important change to the existing infrastructure that supports consumer engagement must be the merging of direct-to-consumer marketing and trade promotion. Emotional progress is being made, simply because so many are talking about this; but the barrier to real collaboration between sales and marketing still exists. Digital transformation is best accomplished through the integration and alignment between direct-to-consumer and trade promotion planning. Hopefully, what digital transformation brings us will be the ability to relate the consumer demand and shopping intentions with the predictive intelligence that drives traffic into the store (or yes, onto the ecommerce sites) to purchase the products. Sales volumes would then represent the logical inventory loading to ensure enough shelf coverage and the alignment of trade funds with direct consumer marketing would cover the necessary tactics to ensure the consumer picks up the product and puts it into the basket. The sad news is that the technology exists right now; but the desire to make this quantum leap does not.  Isn’t this the ultimate purpose of consumption forecasting?</p>
    <p>From what I have seen over the past two years, it may take the retailers themselves to drive this collaboration. As the recipients of the trade spend, they now share their intense focus on getting as much money as they can from their suppliers with their very survival against the onslaught of ecommerce. They won’t accept status quo for much longer.</p>
    <p><strong><em>#5 Retail Execution</em></strong></p>
    <p>This key component of the promotion management process has always been an area of concern for consumer products manufacturers. Ensuring that the product is on the shelf, the displays and marketing assets are in place and that the products have the right pricing, location, assortments, and so on. The key to excellence in retail execution or any direct store distribution (DSD) process is to have immediate access to information about the store, including inventory, trade promotion performance, compliance, and of course order management.</p>
    <p>I have seen this aspect of the promotion process balloon in the past five years to become a major issue today. It has been my observation that for the past few decades, the attention given this critical function has been rather cyclical. The technology today is creating a new cycle. High turnover of field merchandising reps, poor technology, limited access to key data on promotions, inventory and shipments all combine to make this a very difficult and costly process for every consumer products company. But the good news is that, with digital transformation becoming a common business initiative for consumer products companies these days, retail execution is gaining significance as one of the best ways to ensure that the “last 100 feet” will not torpedo a well-planned promotion with poor compliance and empty shelves. There is no better example of a use case for digital technology than retail execution and DSD.<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Retail-Execution.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9990 alignright" height="199" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Retail-Execution-300x199.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>
    <p>Vendors are shoring up their offerings in retail execution and DSD by going to cloud platforms with powerful data management and rapid access to supply chain, promotion, corporate marketing, transportation/logistics and warehouse data that ensures that the consumer can locate and buy the right product at the right price. Planning calendar technology with integrated trade promotion and marketing event calendars combine with powerful project management functionality to enable field management teams to effectively plan and execute store visits in a far more efficient and effective manner. Older ruggedized handheld mobile devices have given way to sleek tablet devices that are richer in delivery of data, 3D views of planograms and assortment planning tools and real-time updates on shipment pipelines all the way back to the factory. While we will clearly have a long way to go, we have accelerated the capabilities of on-site store management that helps to prevent failures in compliance and increase the chances of success for the promotions.</p>
    <p>The prevailing definition of <em>Digital Transformation</em> is the process of changing the way things are done using digital technology. But it also means applying digital technology to new forms of <em>innovation</em> and being creative in the way we address the existing paradigms of operation and seek new ways of working.</p>
    <p>So, in other words, digital transformation is outside-of-the-box thinking about how things should be done and a way to make those new ways reality. We’ve addressed five examples above; but the true nature of digital transformation for trade promotion is going to mean how we humans need to change as well.</p>
    <p>That’s my two cents.</p>
