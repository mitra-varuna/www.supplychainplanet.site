Last week I finished working on the comments and handed in the final work. The process now consists of three more steps that can take another three to four month: First, I have to do a (really) short presentation of my thesis topic. Second, I have to wait for two written evaluations by two professors of the university. Last, I have to defend my thesis, hopefully some time around December.</p>
    
    	<p>This week was again slow on new good articles. Since this did happen before I decided to change this format to a bi-weekly pattern. I hope this helps to keep the quality of the linked articles up.</p>
    
    	<h5>Already tweeted</h5>
    
    	<p>This week on twitter there was a lot of buzz about an article called <a href="http://www.automationworld.com/can-automation-reduce-supply-chain-risk" title="Automation World">Can Automation Reduce Supply Chain Risk?</a> Interesting question, but after skimming over it I decided not to join the hype.</p>
    
    	<p>Why?<br />
    The article does summarize a study by the <span class="caps">EEF</span>, which I wrote about two weeks ago (<a href="http://scrmblog.com/content/insourcing-this-week-in-supply-chain-management-33-2012" title="SCRM Blog: Insourcing - This Week in Supply Chain Management - 33 / 2012">here</a>).<br />
    Of course, there is nothing wrong with writing about old stuff. I do it all the time, as long as the topic might still be relevant.</p>
    
    	<p>But the problem is: the article called &#8220;Can Automation Reduce Supply Chain Risk?&#8221; does simply not answer the question posed&#8230; Beside the title there is not a single mention of the word <em>automation</em> in the rest of the article.</p>
    
    	<p>But still there were some interesting articles I already tweeted about this week:</p>
