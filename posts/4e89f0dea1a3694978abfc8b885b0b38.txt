    <p><strong>How Things Stood</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">In June 2017, while working with Jindal Steel &amp; Power Ltd., I was transferred to the remote eastern-Indian town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barbil</a> for raw material procurement assignments. The nearest airport was 6 hours away, and I was one of only four women among over 500 employees at the location.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">My lifestyle of living in a metropolitan city had gone for a toss. There wasn’t anything to do recreationally. The gym at the community centre barely had any equipment. I needed to change my food habits because the kind of food I normally ate wasn’t available in the cafeteria and I didn’t have the option to cook. My health suffered.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Long story short: I wasn’t very happy with where I was, or the work that I was doing. I wanted to learn more about supply chain management. I wanted to learn and work with advanced technologies in my day-to-day work. I wanted a change.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">I started considering options – pursue a second master’s, get into management consulting, or work in a start-up in the logistics industry. I already had a post-grad diploma in Management and didn’t want to move to another company in the same industry. Pursuing a master’s would be the most challenging one, and required a huge investment of money and time, yet promised to be the most rewarding. Precisely why I decided to risk it. Soon enough, I got myself a <a href="https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GMAT exam appointment</a> due in 2 months and began preparing with the little time I had after work.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My First GMAT</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">I borrowed some GMAT study material from friends, without signing up for any mock exams. I thought the two complementary <a href="https://www.mba.com/exam-prep/gmat-official-starter-kit-practice-exams-1-and-2-free" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GMAT prep tests</a> would suffice.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Verbal Ability was challenging for me: I had to improve a lot across all its three sections – Sentence Correction, Critical Reasoning, and Reading Comprehension. I enthusiastically practiced the Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning sections, ignoring Reading Comprehension, and took two GMAT prep tests a week before the exam, scoring 720 and 730. Although my accuracy didn’t improve over these past two months, my scores assured me that I was ready for the exam.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">On the actual exam, however, I ended up with a score of 700 (the score appears almost immediately after the end of the exam), with 50 in Quantitative Ability and 34 in Verbal Ability, making me realize that GMAT required a lot more preparation than I had anticipated.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Learning Curve</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">I decided to give it another try and this time vowed to prepare more systematically. I needed at least 720 to increase my chances of getting into top schools in the US. I bought a GMAT prep course from a popular Indian educational start-up <a href="https://byjus.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Byju’s</a>, which had video lectures on various concepts and exclusive sectional tests, along with a series of full GMAT practice tests. Beginning in August, with 45 days to the exam, I spent four hours every day after work at the lectures and the practice questions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">In three weeks, I saw my accuracy improving and took my first full practice test from Byju’s. The level of difficulty was much more compared to the previous GMAT prep tests I took, and I only scored a 690. My confidence levels fell, and I now decided to get the popular <a href="https://www.manhattanprep.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Manhattan Prep</a> test series for extensive practice. I continued to take sectional tests on weekdays and full practice tests on weekends. My scores still ranged between 680 and 730, yet I could feel that there was considerable improvement in my accuracy and speed. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and loved having a goal to achieve outside of my work.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What A Good GMAT Score Meant For Me</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Although I had prepared well this time, I felt nervous on the day of the exam. I was relieved when I finally saw my score of 750. With complete confidence to aim for the best, I decided to go all in and put out the best college applications that I possibly could. And I did. A good GMAT score counts for a lot in your grad school applications, and also makes a good impression on your resume when you interview with companies for full-time positions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><em>To me, the seemingly small success of scoring 750 on GMAT opened up the doors to bigger possibilities in my life. </em>Back in Barbil, if somebody had told me that I would be going to <a href="https://mit.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MIT</a> a year later, I wouldn’t have believed them. I am glad that I made that effort to do well on the exam and it made all the difference.</p>
