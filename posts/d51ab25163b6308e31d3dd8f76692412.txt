    <p style="text-align: left;">We are leaders. We are THE first cohort of students to have been successfully admitted to the Blended Masters in Supply Chain Program at MIT after completing a rigorous 16-month online program. We showed the world how we can balance supply – “Time” and demand – “a Full-time job, Family and Study” with two constants &#8211; Grit and Determination.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Cambridge extended a warm welcome to us on January 4th 2018 with a snow-storm. We 40 students came from different parts of the world and met in a cozy coffee room in E40. The room was buzzing with energy and excitement. President Reif welcomed us and reminded us of the great responsibility we had as the first cohort &#8211; to show the world that this new form of “hybrid” education attracts the smartest and the best people who embody the values of MIT that are Integrity, Meritocracy, Diversity, Creativity and Collaboration.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">We embrace diversity. We represent 23 countries and we believe that we can conquer the world with the strength of our combined experiences. We have in our class an ex-Chief Officer for a 42 tonne Maersk vessel, a retired Olympic athlete, someone who ran Analytics in the office of the CEO for a multi-billion dollar company, ex-Management Consultants, entrepreneurs and more. With almost a decade of experience behind each of us, we are all experts in our own fields. However, we are all humble and eager to learn from everyone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">We are ONE team. Through the first four weeks, we all have become more self-aware, and learnt to collaborate and empathize with each other. As the President of the class, I wish that this Blended Master’s program is successful not just for each of the students but for MIT as well. We will be paving the way for universities globally to offer more such “hybrid” programs in years to come.</p>
