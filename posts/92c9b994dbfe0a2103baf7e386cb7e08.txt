    <p>Aceil, my wife, has done the test and it’s come back, not with a grade but two little blue lines: She is pregnant. That’s the best news I have heard while at MIT. Having a baby when you are a student is as exciting as it gets, but it can be overwhelming. Lucky for us, MIT has a lot of resources for new parents. MIT offers the Spouses &amp; Partners Connect, Pediatrics meetings, Post-Partum Support and Breastfeeding Classes, prenatal yoga in addition to top medical care right on campus.</p>
    <p>As a father to be, my favorite class by far is a Childbirth class taught by Wendy Mackey-Kydd an experienced birth companion. Both parents attend a very small class once a week. The class is fairly intimate with 4 or 5 other couples. Wendy, covered the fundamentals of childbirth such as relaxation, position practice, massage and breathing and we left with a &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of support techniques and lots of practice. We were also introduced to breastfeeding and early postpartum.</p>
    <p>A tour of Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, MA was included. The birth center is family centered and is considered to be one of the most prominent Massachusetts. It was an opportunity to see the birthing rooms: Mothers stay in one room through labor, delivery, and recovery, and rooms are equipped with private baths and showers; some rooms even have Jacuzzis. (Aceil’s favorite)</p>

    <p>The class gave us an opportunity to meet other new parents, hear their stories and learn from their experiences. It was a chance for my wife to meet other mommies to-be and bond over what is supposed to be the greatest gift of all.</p>
    <p>There is more at MIT than just homework and exams; It is an inclusive community both for students and spouses that will support and nurture you so you can get the best out of your 1 year as a student, both inside and outside classrooms.</p>
