    <p>Hello from Cambridge! It is early November as we are writing this first blog article, and the Boston weather has just turned. Some of us from colder climates were prepared, some of us less so (looking at you, Singaporeans). We were lucky enough to have extended warm days this year that allowed us to get out and explore the area. In future articles, we will introduce some of the fun leisure and cultural activities that Boston has to offer through the summer and autumn seasons!</p>
    <p>It’s been a hectic three months filled with orientation, classes, recruiting, and capstone/thesis projects, and right now we are celebrating the end of midterms!</p>
    <p>Through the SCM blog we hope to share a little of our story, introduce you to the fascinating people in the program, and give you a peek into what it’s actually like to be an SCM student at MIT! We will showcase our experiences, insights, and the challenges we face over the course of this year. We hope that you gain a broad understanding for what the program offers and that our thoughts may help you find out if MIT is a fit for you and your graduate school experience.</p>
    <p>Talk to you soon!</p>
