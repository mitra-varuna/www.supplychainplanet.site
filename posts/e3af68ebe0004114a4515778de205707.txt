    <p>“Danger, Will Robinson!”  For those of my non-millennial colleagues who have seen reruns or even us Baby-Boomers who actually saw the show, the 1965-68 TV series <em>Lost in Space</em> produced some rather kooky, if not downright weird images. The now famous “B9” robot character would sound out this monotoned warning when it sensed a potential threat to his small companion, played by Billy Mumy.</p>
    <p>The late 1960’s version of an intended application of futuristic artificial intelligence (AI) certainly played its role well, running the entire ship and providing immediate real-time intelligence about the surrounding environment. We know from the already rapidly emerging technology application of AI that having the ability to crunch though unbelievable amounts of data, accounting for millions of potential scenarios and data variables, delivers an application to business that is virtually limitless.<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Human-and-Robot-small.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9589 alignright" height="187" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Human-and-Robot-small-300x300.jpg" width="187" /></a></p>
    <p>I can’t help but chuckle, though, at the prospect of a sales rep creating a promotion plan in an AI-based modeling tool only to have it blurt out, “Danger, Will Robinson,” or the sales rep’s name to warn of an impending disaster if he commits it to his plan. OK, not really, but I couldn’t resist. There is a clear wave of acceptance now for trade promotion optimization that enables predictive modeling and advanced forecasting of promotion return on investment.  But there is a problem, indeed. The purpose of a trade promotion optimization tool is to create a promotion with a high level of confidence in the compelling reason to spend the money. If you ask a sales rep if they are willing to bet their jobs on the TPO-produced ROI, I think you might get a lot of blank stares, or even a laugh or two.</p>
    <p><strong>Poisoned Well?</strong></p>
    <p>The truth is that we all know and accept that AI-driven optimization tools are coming fast. The traditional methods of promotion optimization lack something – even for those vendors who have deployed TPO solutions for several years now. While their technology has been tested and deployed under real conditions, there are still concerns over the accuracy of the projected or predicted outcomes. This is not usually an issue with the application&#8217;s data science, rather with the source of data. “It’s giving us a predicted lift figure that makes sense to us,” says one regional vice president of sales for a global cosmetics leader. “But it is frustrating when we can’t seem to climb over a mediocre percentage of actual ROI no matter what our initial combination of tactics is.”  He goes on to say that there is little confidence in their TPO among his sales force, even with a corporate mandate that every deal has to have the TPO-produced ROI figure before approval.</p>
    <p>Time and again, we see statistics showing that trade promotion performance ROI is viewed at no higher than 60%. Given those averages, one must question the logic of basing the optimization source data on historical tactics and transactions that produce consistently marginal results. There are also several questions posed about baselines and lift coefficients that are either out of date or, again, based on less than strong performance results.</p>
    <p><strong>Premium Octane Fuel</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking with the trade promotion manager of a large regional grocery chain, I was told they regularly achieve better than 85% accuracy on their TPO. When asked why she felt they could obtain those consistent figures, she pointed out that their consumer data was probably the secret sauce. They include more consumer sales tracking data than their suppliers, and most importantly, it is near real time. “We really do use past promotion performance data, but we also leverage the store traffic, loyalty, and consumption data we get on an almost daily basis,” she pointed out. She also stated that her buyers regularly question the TPO figures of their suppliers and, in some cases they will not consider them at all.</p>
    <p>As I have previously pointed out, the digital technology and real-time capacity to understand the consumer&#8217;s shopping experiences, feedback, and habits fuel the most incredible data source consumer products retailers and suppliers have ever had.  Most TPO technology that I have observed today lacks the ability to integrate this type of information.  Some tools do bring in point-of-sale data and some actually leverage their demand signal repository data as well, But is that enough?  And the real question is whether or not the current class of TPO tools has the ability to generate real-time predictive analyses using this type of consumer data. I would not bet on today&#8217;s technology to handle it.</p>
    <p>I<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_309251195.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-9591 alignleft" height="174" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_309251195-300x200.jpg" width="261" /></a> am sure that a million dollar top fuel dragster will not break 300 mph with regular gas – it will always require a powerful blend of fuel like nitro methane.  Likewise, the money spent on AI technology is going to be justified because it is the best, and probably only technology existing today that will deliver the end results that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>both</em></span> the retailer and supplier will accept. The speed and volume of processing capability of AI needs the most current, accurate and trustworthy data sources you can supply. The use of historical trade promotion transactions is important, no doubt; but to deliver near-100% accuracy of predictive ROI, the AI-TPO will need the full 360° coverage of the consumer demand via online shopping footprint, point of sale data, social listening and sensitivity analyses, weather and local event data, and past purchase history, to name a few key sources. To maximize the value, AI can run a variety of scenarios against the real historical performance to sense and build more realistic, precise and trusted patterns which can be used to create the right combination of promotion tactics, timing, products and cost.  If you add in cognitive and machine learning to grow the level of intelligence of the engine, we may get to that figure sooner rather than later.</p>
    <p><strong>The Buyer’s Dilemma</strong></p>
    <p>My email is abuzz with conversations about trade promotion optimization issues. Clearly, having the ability to accurately predict success of the huge amount of trade promotion spending must be one of the most important decisions a consumer products manufacturer or retailer will make. AI is already taking center stage in every vendor’s roadmap, so the question of availability is on everyone’s lips. There are several strong AI systems like Watson, Einstein, and so on; but I recently had one of the AI development managers tell me that 18 months is not out of the question for availability. So the buyer&#8217;s dilemma of buy now or wait is a real concern.</p>
    <p>Considering that it will take trade promotion, sales, marketing and finance planners along with some well-informed data scientists to create the design specifications and math for a commercial AI-TPO, I HOPE it’s only 18 months! But all indicators are that it will not only be longer, but will definitely be worth the wait.</p>
