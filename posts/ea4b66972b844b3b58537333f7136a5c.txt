    <p>Bienvenido a MIT! Congratulations on your admission to the SCMr program &#8211; or if you are still thinking about applying, get it done!</p>
    <p>I guess you might have some concerns about flying 8000+ km from Santiago to Boston.</p>
    <p>Sure, if you like the sun and beaches you might be in for a rough time once fall sets in, unless you are coming in from Punta Arenas – then you might even like it.</p>
    <p>Seriously, it is a long distance from home. But you will find a welcoming environment here. Most of the cohort will be in the exact same position as you.</p>
    <p><strong>Chileans at MIT</strong></p>
    <p>Though it might be unlikely to find a fellow countryman in the cohort, there is a large Chilean community at MIT and in the Greater Boston area.</p>
    <p>Today you can find about 90 of us in a Chilean-MIT WhatsApp group. Most are MBA students and their Significant Others (SOs), but there are some undergraduates and PhD students as well, from different fields and doing very interesting research. With them, you can feel right at home.</p>
    <p>The first big holiday you will miss is “18 de septiembre”, but the Chilean community will have you covered, including some good empanadas. Above you can see the picture of the MIT crew at the Fonda (Chilean-themed BBQ), organized right here in campus. This community will also organize welcoming parties, Christmas dinner, and other events through the year. Make sure you join!</p>
    <p>Another organization you should get to know is <a href="http://www.chilemass.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ChileMass</a>. Not only will they organize interesting presentations and such events; they act as a matching agent, promoting collaboration between Chile and Massachusetts. The key areas of focus are Energy, Technology, Education and Venture Capital. I encourage you to contact them now if any of those areas are of your interest.</p>
    <p><strong>Becas Chile</strong></p>
    <p>If you are concerned about the <a href="https://www.conicyt.cl/becasconicyt/category/fichas-concursos/becas-en-el-extranjero/becas-de-postgrado-becas-chile/becas-de-magister-convocatoria-2012/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Becas Chile</a> scholarship. Unlike an MBA, the SCMr program is eligible for the International Masters Scholarship.</p>
    <p>I submitted my application categorizing the program as Subarea OECD Economics &amp; Business, and WOS: Management Sciences and Op. Research, this will ensure you get 5/5 for the most important evaluation criteria.</p>
    <p>Now if you do get the scholarship, I would recommend you don’t wait until the final signature (from Contraloria). Go ahead and present the documentation for sponsored billing – because if you are not aware, know that bureaucracy can sometimes be “rather slow” and the outstanding billing emails can be stressful.</p>
    <p>If you have any other doubts about the program, the city, Becas Chile, or anything else, just find me online and ask me about it. Welcome to MIT. Exito!</p>
