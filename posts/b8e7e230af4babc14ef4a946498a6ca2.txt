    <p style="text-align: justify;">The short answer: YES (if you’re ready to work). Originally from Los Angeles, CA, I am currently a student in the inaugural class of the SCMb (Supply Chain Management Blended) Program. While I have only been in school for three months, I can say that the experience has been invaluable. You have to come ready to work  (sometimes from 9am-9pm), but in return you will learn how to operate under a deadline, juggle multiple team projects, work on diverse teams (some great, some not so good), listen to some incredible lecturers and guest speakers, and make some lifelong friendships. Just as important, doors open for job opportunities and additional graduate studies when you join this program.</p>
    <p><strong>Here’s my advice to a prospective student:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Did you enjoy the SCx classes</strong>? If so, then the on-campus program adds another dimension to your education. The first month (January) you participate in a series of mini-courses with students visiting from MIT-affiliated supply chain programs around the world. Starting in February, you begin the regular full semester classes. I can say that the classes on-campus continue the technical learning (optimization, linear programming, data analytics), but add in equally important management classes and team building activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Look at the curriculum on the SCM website</strong> (<a href="http://scm.mit.edu/scm-blended-curriculum">SCMb curriculum</a>). Click on each class to see a description of the course. Are you interested in learning the material? Here’s an insider tip: SCM students can also sign up for classes at MIT’s Sloan School of Business. While some classes fill up quickly, you still have access to the majority of the classes MBA students take at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Find recent alum</strong>. Google search “scm resume book mit” and you will find a link to the resumes of last year’s class.
    <ul>
    <li>Select an email in the resume and send that person a message to ask about the program or just email me (see email address below)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You already have this piece of advice covered: <strong>read the</strong> <strong>MIT SCM program student blog</strong> (<a href="https://mitscmprogram.wordpress.com/">blog</a>) to hear first-hand experiences of previous students.</li>
    <li><strong>Can you handle the cold weather</strong>? It can get chilly in Cambridge during the winter months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? Get researching and see if this program is for you. At least for me, it was one of the best career decisions I have ever made.</p>
