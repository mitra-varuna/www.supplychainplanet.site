    <p>For those of you who&#8217;ve been following supplychaintrend for a while, you know I&#8217;ve written many blogs about how mindset improves S&amp;OP and business performance. And maybe more importantly, it can also improve employee well-being.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m pleased that in collaboration with the leading European Supply Chain Platform &#8211; Supply Chain Movement &#8211; I developed a checklist to assess if your organisation has an effective mindset.</p>
    <p>The checklist has 10 questions you have to answer with yes or no. It will hold up a mirror and will give you a good indication on what your organisation mindset looks like and where it can improve.</p>
    <p>You can find the <a href="https://www.supplychainmovement.com/checklist-sop-mindset/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">S&amp;OP Mindset Checklist here</a></p>
