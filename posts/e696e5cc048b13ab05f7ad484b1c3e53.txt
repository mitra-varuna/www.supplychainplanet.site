    <p><strong>It’s challenging to attend a one-year program and we know it! Want to save your time to have some more time to study, look for a job or just relax? Here are some tips for you.</strong></p>
    <p>A deadline is looming, and your team has an intensive day to submit the assignment before midnight. When you wake up the next day, there is another deadline waiting for you. This is the true life at MIT, especially during this 10-month master’s program: a race against deadlines. Here we come up with some tips for time management based on our experience. Hope it will be helpful for you to enjoy the time on campus!</p>
    <p><strong>Make a reasonable schedule.</strong> It is fascinating when you come back to school and find out so many things worth exploring: classes in different fields, sailing on the Charles River, and partying with new friends. Class reviews and feedback from seniors are useful when selecting courses. A reasonable schedule is one way to make you productive and to have a balanced life. Just remember to plan sufficient buffer time for interview preparation since interviews may be more time consuming and intensive than the classes. You can use Firehose for a nice course plan! But don’t fully trust the website, it sometimes has errors on time or classroom. <a href="https://www.firehose.guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.firehose.guide/</a></p>

    <p><strong>Start early. </strong>Things can take longer than expected, especially for system dynamics or data mining assignments. Additionally, if there is a call for on-site interviews, you may have to squeeze in time for preparation and postpone the start time for the assignments. This is a reinforcing loop for catching deadlines. Always start early, plan early, and do not push to the last minute to wrap up everything, so you have time to polish your work and make the best deliverables.</p>
    <p><strong>Save time on groceries.</strong> MIT shuttle service offers easier access to more nutritious food options. There&#8217;re two types of shuttles: Costco/Target Shuttle and Trader Joe’s/Whole Foods Market Shuttle. Costco is great for bulk purchases, while Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods are better for organic foods. During the academic year, the Costco/Target Shuttle only operates on specified Sundays, but the Trader Joe’s/Whole Foods Market Shuttle is available every Sunday. If you choose Costco, make sure you get enough food until the next trip.

    <p>School is quite different from your job, and it takes time to transition back to school. Although there is a more flexible time schedule, you have a much broader scope and diversified portfolio. Instead of one or two projects at a time, you may have to deal with five projects on five different teams. Multi-task skills and teamwork are critical. We hope these recommendations will be helpful to you as you enter MIT.</p>
