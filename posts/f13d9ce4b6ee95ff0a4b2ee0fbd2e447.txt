    <p>Fear not! With these insider tips, you will be able to approach the career fair with confidence.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Get there early. The fair will be busy nonstop, from when doors open at 10 AM in the morning until closing time at 4 PM. Foot traffic will not decrease until companies start packing up at the end of the day. Therefore, get there early before the Z Center fills to capacity</li>
    <li>Dress for success. The generally accepted dress code is business professional. Make sure to pick out your outfit the night before to make sure everything is in order. Many companies have recently embraced a more informal culture where a t-shirt and jeans are accepted and expected from its employees and candidates. However, these companies are understanding of the dress code, so do not be concerned that you may appear to be over dressed for the event.</li>
    <li>Bring a bookbag. Most people are so worried about their appearance they often forget to bring anything else along with them. A bookbag will help keep your hands free. When you approach a recruiter, you will want to be able to commit to a firm handshake to start your conversation. Having to juggle your belongings around as you walk up to them may seem like a minor consideration, but being able to flawlessly transition from waiting in line to starting a conversation will help you feel more at ease as you launch into your elevator pitch.</li>
    <li>Practice your elevator pitch. The famous elevator pitch concept is a tried and true method for helping someone understand what skills you bring to the table and what you are capable of accomplishing. However, these recruiters are going to hear hundreds of elevator pitches on this day. Try to think of something unique! Yes, it is impressive that you will graduate from MIT, but so will everyone else they speak with throughout the day. An elevator pitch does not necessarily have to be all about your past work experience. integrate company facts into your pitch, or perhaps share a humorous anecdote that showcases some of your leadership skills. Any of these options can help you stand out in a very accomplished crowd of your peers.</li>
    <li>Go in with a plan. The career fair is huge. You will not be able to talk to every company. There is simply not enough time to do so! MIT will publish a list of participating companies and a map of where to find them in the weeks before the event. Prioritize who you want to speak with and create a route. If you have time leftover before 4 PM, feel free to explore other companies that pique your interest throughout the day.</li>
    <li>Do not be afraid to stay late. The fair closes at 4 PM, and announcements will encourage you to leave. <em>But</em> <em>you do not have to leave exactly at 4 PM</em>. Walk around near closing time and offer to help an employer pack up their things. This is a great chance to spark up a conversation on a more informal level. You may even be offered the leftover giveaways to take home and share with your friends.</li>
    <li>Speaking of giveaways… See something you like? Take it! See a cool t-shirt on a table? Really like the stationery at one booth? Walk up and grab it. At the very least, you will be able to take some cool/functional items for your time at the fair. Don’t forget to grab a business card too!</li>
    <li>Be prepared to win over skeptical audiences. Remember, most companies at the fair are seeking out traditional engineering students. As someone who identifies as more of a businessman than an engineer within the SCM program, I decided to own this fact and I encourage those of you that are like minded to do the same. I often would open conversations by saying: “I understand you are looking for engineers, but as someone with ‘X’ years of experience in such and such industry, I know I can bring value to your company despite the fact I am not a traditional candidate.” This approach allowed me to get my foot in the door with companies that may have otherwise turned me away based upon the experience listed on my resume alone.</li>
    <li>Lastly and most importantly, do not forget about the and the rest of the CTL staff have done a tremendous job creating a robust network of employers and alumni that will give you a direct line to opportunities that align with supply chain organizations. Although it is extremely beneficial to forge your own connections through the career fair, historically speaking, a majority of SCM students find their next opportunity through the in-house resources open exclusively to SCM students.</li>
