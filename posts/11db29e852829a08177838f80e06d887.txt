    <p><em>On
    the best days, MIT is the most fun and terrifying roller coaster on earth.&nbsp; On the worst, it’s fight club…and you’re
    losing.&nbsp; You hate to love it, love to
    hate it, count down the seconds until graduation, and miss it fiercely when you
    are gone.&nbsp; MIT is hard…really hard, but
    nobody said the best things in life were easy.</em><em></em></p>

    <p>To be clear, when I call MIT a fight club, it’s you against the Institute, not other students.&nbsp; Your classmates are in your corner.&nbsp;&nbsp; You do feel beat up, though.&nbsp; And when you get back on your feet, you also realize that MIT is the most magical place on earth, except perhaps Hogwarts (if Hogwarts were packed full of Hermiones).&nbsp; </p>
    
    
    
    <p>&nbsp;As we walked into Killian Court on graduation day in 2013, that magic was alive and well.&nbsp; Looking up at the iconic dome I was in awe…and I was relieved.&nbsp; I was also soaked and cold; it poured rain for most of the ceremony.&nbsp; The paramount conclusion of 4 years of sweat, love, tears, and triumphs was finally here.&nbsp; Not even cold rain could ruin it.&nbsp; I was proud, and I was exhausted.&nbsp; I loved MIT, and I was letting it go.</p>

    <p>Why am I back?&nbsp; Great question!&nbsp; The seed of change was planted in early 2016 when I was hired as a production scheduler at a chemical plant.&nbsp; I felt at home at the plant, but not so much in the supply chain department.&nbsp; I couldn’t have defined supply chain management if I wanted to.&nbsp; And without really thinking about it, I turned to MIT for help. &nbsp;I searched <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX.org</a> for supply chain classes and stumbled upon <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-analytics-mitx-ctl-sc0x-2">SC0x</a>.&nbsp; I signed up at once!&nbsp; When I learned about the <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-supply-chain-management">MicroMasters</a> program I probably said something like “That’s nonsense; it’s not a real degree” under my breath.&nbsp; Upon completion of SC0x I went right into <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-fundamentals-0">SC1x</a>.&nbsp; This <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/">MicroMasters</a> thing was making me better and more comfortable at my job.&nbsp; I was calculating safety stocks like a boss and made plans to finish the MicroMasters.&nbsp; When I had completed 3 classes, and was deep in the throes of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-dynamics-mitx-ctl-sc3x-2">SC3x</a>, I was invited to SCM Bootcamp and attended in August 2017.&nbsp; </p>
    
    
    
    <p>I felt the spark the minute my foot touched campus.&nbsp; My nerdy soul was awake and I didn’t even realize it had been asleep.&nbsp; <a href="https://ctl.mit.edu/education/mit-scx-bootcamp">Supply Chain Bootcamp</a> was an intense week filled with case studies, fast friends, thrilling lectures, tireless group projects, and the all-too-familiar sleep deprivation.&nbsp; Everything I loved and hated about MIT was packed into a single week.&nbsp; And at the end, I wanted more.&nbsp; I was home for a minute, but I wanted to be home forever.&nbsp; Applying to the blended program was my plane ticket back.&nbsp; Even though I will only be on campus for 5 months, I will always be a part of <a href="https://ctl.mit.edu/scale">MIT’s global supply chain community</a>.&nbsp; And this time, when I graduate, I won’t let it go.&nbsp; </p>
    
    
    
    <p>So now I am doing one of the hardest things any MIT student has ever done: admitting that I was WRONG!&nbsp; The <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/scm/">MicroMasters</a> IS a real degree.&nbsp; It is a rigorous curriculum full of applicable concepts and a theoretical understanding of Supply Chain Management as a field.&nbsp; Thanks to the MicroMasters staff, I feel well prepared as I enter my first and final semester as an SCM master’s student at MIT.&nbsp; </p>
    
    
    
    <p>I did come back to school and to MIT!&nbsp; On <a href="https://commencement.mit.edu/">June 7, 2019</a> (exactly 6 years to the day since the first time), I will once again be sitting in Killian Court looking up at the dome.&nbsp; Hopefully the weather will be better, but I know the feeling will be the same!&nbsp; I will be surrounded by friends, family, and magic celebrating the culmination of years of hard work and the start of more hard work to come.&nbsp; I didn’t come back to MIT because it was easy.&nbsp; I came back because it was difficult, AND worth it!&nbsp; I have learned that hard work is always worth it! </p>
    
    
    
    <p>I
    came back to MIT and I would do it again…maybe I even will!</p>
    
    
    
    <p>(But I will never ever ever ever get a PhD.)</p>
