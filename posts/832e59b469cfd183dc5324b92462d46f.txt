    <p></p><p>There are lots of folks in the supply chain community that have years of experience. Then there are folks like me who are just cutting their teeth. Newbies such as myself realize how much opportunity is out there because supply chain is just SO BIG, and we start down a new career path bewildered and full of questions. “What should I do? How does that work? What does this mean?” Sometimes it’s a little intimidating to ask those questions because you’re trying to impress your new boss and don’t want to seem stupid. Trust me, I know. I came from a technology background so I can talk cloud and big data with the best of them. But now, applying cloud and big data to supply chain processes? Let me get back to you on that. Needless to say I’ve been reading reports, articles, and blogs—you name it—to get up to speed. I’ll get comfortable; I just have to be patient.</p>
    <p>But for many of you, there may not be the set of resources I have access to. So what should you do in that instance? Well, I have an answer for you. So gather round and I’ll share some tips I’ve learned about starting off in this industry (or any other for that matter).</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Be in the thick of things</strong>. My dad always told me to be involved in a role that money flows through. That way you increase your value to the company and you can really see what’s going on in the organization. I’d like to extend that a bit to being involved in a role where goods flow through. You become a person of value because you understand the health of the organization, and often you can see instances for improvement. Make the suggestion on how to improve the supply chain and you’re on your way to making a brand for yourself as an innovator. The balance to that is making sure you have support from someone senior when you start making suggestions. Pointing out ways to improve a business you’re just starting out in without air cover from a senior exec could be risky and you could put yourself in political hot water. So get a good read on the lay of the land and the company DNA. Are they open to suggestions or is it a NIH (not invented here) mentality? I’ve worked in those kinds of organizations and it’s tough when you’re a problem solver but are still seen as an outsider.</li>

    <li><strong>Be a sponge</strong>. I mentioned earlier that sometimes you might not want to ask questions because you’re afraid to be seen as stupid. Let’s check that thought process at the door. Particularly, since you’ve been through an interview process—and unless you’ve lied through your teeth about your background—your new employer knows your background and supply chain experience. Look at yourself as a blank canvas and you’ve got every paint color in the world in front of you. Take it all in. Ask questions and come up with your own ideas. Then talk through your ideas with more senior people. Start putting ideas together on your own because sometimes you’ve been hired not for your expertise, but for your fresh pair of eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Get a mentor</strong>. Now, this is not to say you start walking up to every senior person you see and start asking, “Are you my mother…er, mentor?” This is taking the time to invest in relationships with senior people, asking their opinions, and making an organic connection with someone you respect and can learn something from. I’ve coached junior peers and I’ve been coached on career advice, educational pursuits, projects, and client interactions; it’s as rewarding to me as it is to them in both roles. I recently had someone I counseled three years ago come back and tell me she wanted to pursue an MBA and wanted my advice. I’m tickled that she’s pursuing her dream and wanted me to help her achieve it. And I still talk to my first sales manager from ten years and four jobs ago. I get his input on my career trajectory, how to deal with difficult people, when to hold ‘em, and when to fold ‘em. ‘Cause there’s nothing new under the sun; and if you can align with someone a little farther down the career path, they can help out you just by sharing their experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Build a network.</strong> That’s something I’ve been lucky enough to have come naturally, connecting with people. It’s probably why I’ve been tasked with building the new Beet Fusion community. So, in the coming weeks I’ll be cutting my teeth on new supply chain info and making new connections with people in new companies, roles and skill sets. I’m excited about it. In a few weeks I’ll throw open the doors to the Beet Fusion community site and invite you all in. Where we’ll talk about our career paths and aspirations, make connections, and help each other along our respective career trajectories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, I want to invite you to a webinar we’re hosting called <a href="https://cc.readytalk.com/r/l5w2ssz63eox&amp;eom"><em>Taking Charge of Your Career</em></a> on Thursday, June 25, 2105 at 11:00 a.m. EDT to share insights from a panel of senior supply chain leaders as they discuss strategies that worked for them and the advice they give to their teams.</p>
