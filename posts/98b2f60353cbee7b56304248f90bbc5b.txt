    <p>I am a mid-career, supply chain professional working at Maersk,
    a Fortune Global 500 company,
    with a good job and pay. Like most mid-career professional, I also have lots of
    responsibilities to my family. As a Chinese, this covers my parents, my wife
    and my lovely 5-year-old daughter. Deciding to pay a considerable amount of
    tuition fee and cease earning is never easy at this stage of life.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>No job in supply chain today will be secure</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>However, as a professional who has taken advantage of the last two decades&#8217; technological advancement, I fully understand that no job in supply chain today will be secure in 10 years from now without adapting to the latest environment. We shall see many technologies in the research lab or in pilot today: AI, machine learning, robotics, autonomous cars and block-chain could shape the future supply chain industry&#8217;s landscape.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>Lifelong learning to remain competitive and relevant</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>The need for lifelong learning becomes obvious: I need to
    remain competitive and relevant. Experience alone would not be able to beat
    graduates who are younger and equipped with the latest skill set that is sought
    by future employers.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>MicroMasters to blended master’s degree path made it an easy decision</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>In 2016, I heard about <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/mitx">MITx</a><ins>,</ins> which offers the <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/">MicroMasters program</a> via one of the biggest Mass Open Online Courses, MOOC platform <a href="http://www.edx.org">edX</a>. The credential itself covered half the curriculum of the #1 ranked MIT master’s degree program. Candidates who successfully completed the credential could apply to the blended MIT <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Users/lance/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/C5JX1EJD/scm.mit.edu">Master’s program</a><ins>,</ins> which only takes 5 months on campus in Cambridge.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The new MicroMasters to blended master’s degree path made it
    an easy decision to go back to school. With a considerably lower cost, a
    shorter time span, it offers a similar learning experience compared to the
    traditional residential program students.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The blended program also admits a very different profile of
    students, MIT admission neither requires them to take the GMAT/GRE test, nor
    even looks at the undergraduate GPA (I barely graduated from my first degree).
    Performance in the five online courses and comprehensive final exam substitutes
    for these items. This allows learners with non-traditional backgrounds and
    education to enter the SCM master’s program.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>Great learning experience and rewards</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>During my study in the MicroMasters, learning was not the only reward. I
    have met up and made friends with other online learners in Hong Kong and South
    China. Five of them ended up in the blended master program and I believe many
    more will be there in later years.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I also serve as a CTA, community teaching assistant, who
    helps the course lead<del> to</del> answer students’ questions in the
    course&#8217;s discussion forums. This helps keeping the community engaged and have a
    better learning experience that many MOOCs are lacking. This role helped me
    know better about how a MOOC is executed, know the MITx team and, most
    rewarding part, to get acknowledgment from students on our effort.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>In September 2018 I also took part in <a href="https://www.thefreshconnection.biz/">The Fresh
    Connection</a> global final, organized by <a href="http://inchainge.com/">Inchainge B.V</a>.<ins>,</ins> a
    leading supply chain simulation game and executive training firm. Together with
    my teammates, I earned <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6452782314589126656">a
    free trip to Milan</a>, Italy. This was an unexpected reward when I took the MicroMasters
    course.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>Looking forward to continuing the journey on campus</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>I had arrived on campus in January. Every week new exciting things happen. For example, the APICS business proposal competition and my capstone project would likely become proposals that I could propose to my employer when I graduate. It proves going to MIT is one of the best decisions in my life.</p>
