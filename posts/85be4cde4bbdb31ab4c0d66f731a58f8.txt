    <p>Summer is ending. 2018 is right around the corner. Is it time to start to plan the new year? Forge a strategy?  Engage employees? At this time of year, we find many companies planning workshops to stimulate thinking on building a digital supply chain and igniting next-generation supply chain thinking. If this is you, we would like to offer to help. We have four opportunities for engagement. Here we share some insights.</p>
    <p><strong>Benchmarking. </strong>How do you stack up to your peer group? To leaders that you admire? The first step to building a guiding a coalition is benchmarking.  Understanding where you are at is critical to forging a forward path. We are offering three types of benchmarking: planning, financial and organizational. How does it help? Use our Metrics That Matter methodology to look at improvement and performance. Use the information to set targets for a balanced scorecard. Analyze your DNA against a peer group in the organizational analysis. Understand inventory write-offs, impact of forecast processes and technology satisfaction in the planning benchmarking. <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/benchmarking/">Please click her for additional information.</a></p>

    <p><strong>Customer-Centric Supply Chain Research.</strong> Want to know what your customers value and how your organization’s performance delivers? We can help by testing customer satisfaction and sharing what matters by channel partner. We will test to understand how you stack-up to your competitors and how to make customer service actionable. We keep all the data confidential and share the insights. Following a research study, we will be glad to educate your team on the results.</p>

Consider playing our new game SCI IMPACT! to drive engagement and think differently. The activity helps employees better understand the value of outside-in processes and supply chain processes. The game is designed to simulate an S&amp;OP environment. At each round, employees gain an understanding of the value of supply chain decisions through the sharing on the Supply Chain Metrics That Matter. The game can be played by 10-100 employees.   For additional information refer to our <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/sci-impact-game/">website.</a></p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/training_three.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9809 size-medium alignright" height="201" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/training_three-300x201.jpg" width="300" /></a>Training. </strong> By 2030, companies will be short 20% of employees at the senior manager and director level. In parallel, processes and technologies are changing. How to keep up? We want to help, we offer three types of training. In April 2016, we began our partnership with CorpU to bring online training to market for seven next generation classes. These can be deployed internally within an organization or teams can assign high performers to our cross-company cohorts that we initiate each twice a year.  Our goal is to help you align and build next-generation supply chain processes and seize new opportunities. We have developed three unique training options for you and your team:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Cross-Company Academy </strong>brings 2-3 employees from a company together with individuals from other companies (for a total of 50 participants) to take the online courses in a social environment within three regions (Americas, Europe, and Asia.) $2500 per person.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/corpu-training/"><strong>Company Cohort </strong></a>is a private program for 30-50 team members within a company to learn new concepts and raise innovative ideas submitted during the course.  Scalable pricing available.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/services/training/"><strong>Bootcamp Intensive</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a two day in-person course with participants from a variety of companies. $1200 per person. Three courses are scheduled for in Philadelphia.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The seven on-line classes are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain Metrics That Matter.</strong>Most companies are working on a cost-driven agenda. How can they shift and drive value, or improve the metrics that matter on the balance sheet? In this course, we explain this journey and help supply chain teams speak the language of the balance sheet with an understanding of how their actions drive business results.</li>
    <li><strong>Making the Digital Pivot.</strong>Supply chains are not equipped to sense, think, and respond intelligently through digitized relationships which provide new sources of data and insight. The digital pivot shifts the focus to outside-in. Extreme connectivity and in-memory analytics enables the redesign of the atoms and electrons of the supply chain. Take this course so that you can build a guiding coalition to drive a digital supply chain to connect it through machine-to-machine and machine-to-human interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Building the Customer-Centric Supply Chain.</strong>To drive growth, supply chains must align the customer response into operations to reflect custom and customer segmentation policies, and so that they can align measures such as cost to serve with profitability. Take this course to build the organizational muscle to move supply chain segmentation into policy and execution.</li>
    <li><strong>The Market-Driven Value Network Journey.</strong>The traditional supply chain is supply centric. As companies deploy growth strategies they need to rethink the principles of demand, become demand-driven, and mature relationships towards market-driven orchestration. In this course, you’ll define a demand glossary and a go-forward plan for the supply chain team to manage demand flows.</li>
    <li><strong>End-to-End Supply Chain Orchestration.</strong>Spreadsheets and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) tools are no longer sufficient to create visibility across the extended value chain, manage planning and unstructured data, or enable hands-free capabilities to get the right data to the right person at the right time. In this class the team builds an end-to-end journey to improve corporate performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Driving Improvement in Decision Making Through Supply Chain Planning.</strong>Supply chain teams must synchronize four planning layers – strategic, tactical, operational and executional – but most tools were implemented within functions without a holistic view, making this synchronization impossible. In this course, learn how to build a supply chain planning roadmap and define the organizational structure. You will recognize what makes a good plan and build processes for evolution.</li>
    <li><strong>Building Agility through Horizontal Processes like S&amp;OP, Supplier Development and Revenue Management.</strong>Agility is the ability of a company to drive volume growth while performing well on customer service, cost and inventory despite the rise of demand and supply uncertainty. Sales &amp; Operations Planning processes are not maturing fast enough to support an organization’s growth objectives and must shift from matching demand with supply at a volumetric level, to maximizing profitability and orchestrating plans that can shift with markets. This course helps to define the concepts for action for the organization to build strength in Sales &amp; Operations Planning (S&amp;OP), Revenue Management, New Product Launch, Supplier Development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) processes to improve corporate performance through cross-functional processes.</li>
