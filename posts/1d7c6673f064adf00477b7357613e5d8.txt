    <p></p><p>I studied strategy and international management during my MBA program because I like to look forward. Back then I wasn’t as interested in the numbers of business, and I still owe my friend Kevin at least a portion of my degree for helping me get through statistics.  So, while I may have hated it, I made it through accounting, finance and statistics, and it prepared me to enter Corporate America.</p>
    <p>Back then I read books like <em>The Tipping Point</em>, <em>The World Is Flat</em>, and <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em>. They shaped how I thought about business. Recently, as I prepared to market our Supply Chain Insights Global Summit, I was introduced to Professor Pankaj Ghemawat’s concepts, and guess what?  I continue to learn. The world isn’t flat; and globalization and trade is changing.</p>
    <p>Dr. Ghemawat talks about lots of things.  On his twitter feed this week he dropped the stats that “While Asia will have over half of worlds megacities (city &gt;10m ppl) by 2030, Africa’s urbanization is skyrocketing” and “Of 8,000 British companies, 96% had no foreign-lang speakers. 1<sup>st</sup> time exporters cite this as barrier to intl mkts.”  As I read, I think, “Wow.  I wonder how companies are preparing for this?”  I then think, “Wow, I wonder how governments are preparing for this.”  And then I think “Wow, I wonder how ANYONE is preparing for this.”  The world is moving faster, getting more connected, and yet we still are behind because I see all this potential out there.</p>

    <p>I’m particularly excited that Dr. Ghemawat is going to keynote our Global Summit this September at the Phoenician.  We’re going to hear first-hand how companies should best prepare for the next wave of corporate evolution, or as he calls it “World 3.0.”  How management teams should invest in developing programs to make their leadership teams think globally.  How trade lines and connectivity are facing more friction in international trade today than before the 2007 recession, and that trade lanes are changing.</p>
    <p>As I prepare, it occurs to me that I wouldn’t be able to look out and forward and truly appreciate everything he’s going to say without having the background in accounting, finance and statistics to bring everything he’s talking about into clearer focus.  I wouldn’t be able to appreciate this experience unless I had prepared myself.  I look forward to the session and gaining the understanding of how the World (the 3.0 version) is going to impact everything around me.  My mind is full of thoughts, and then I think “Wow.  How could anyone that’s involved in Global Business miss this?”</p>
    <p>So, I formally invite you, all of my fellow supply chain gurus, to our <a href="http://supplychaininsightsglobalsummit.com/">Supply Chain Insights Global Summit</a>—September 9-10, 2015 at The Phoenician in Scottsdale, AZ—where you’ll get to hear about how the future trends of trade for the global multinational will change your business, your career; and well, your world.  I promise you’ll leave after two days with a new appreciation for what’s to come. It will also give you a chance to bounce problems and successes off your peers over a round of golf or a beer (and those could happen at the same time I’ve been told) and a chance to play with Baxter and Sawyer. They’re robots! How Cool Is THAT!!!   So put in that request at work, pull your best corporate linen shirt out of your closet (it gets hot in Scottsdale), and build a list of all the questions you ever had about improving your supply chain.  I promise. You’ll get all the answers you need and more.</p>
