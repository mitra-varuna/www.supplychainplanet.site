    <p></p><p>It is the end of the year. We have been in business for the last ten months, and I think that it is a good time to reflect and give thanks.  Supply Chain Insights is a small, focused team of nine people, and we remain committed to our mission to serve the line-of-business supply chain leaders so they have a voice and a place to turn to understand advances in supply chain excellence.  In closing the year, we give thanks for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>The opportunity. </strong>We give thanks for our customers.<strong> </strong>It is our goal to be the <em>easy to do business with</em> industry analyst company. We give thanks for the thirty customers that invested in Supply Chain Insights that made our dream possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Those that Helped.</strong>   Over the course of the last six months, we have published nineteen reports and completed the book Bricks Matter. We publish based on the principles of open content research, but this could not have been possible without the help from the 250 supply chain professionals from over 150 companies that completed our surveys and participated in our research projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Those that have believed. </strong>We have over 400 participants in our Supply Chain Insights Community. These early adopters are learning how to network with other leaders. Early in the year, we will be adding more fun.  We are planning to do an upgrade and remodeling of the community in January.  We will continue to enhance it over the year. We want to be the place that supply chain leaders can go to network with other leaders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have a wonderful holiday. May your holiday giving supply chain work without any issues.</p>
