    <p></p><p>We close 2013 giving thanks. We give thanks for our customers and their support over the past two years. This support allows us the freedom to do what we do.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Supply Chain Insights will be two years old. We continue to have fun. Our focus is to unveil supply chain insights through research that allows leaders to drive new discussions. Over the course of the last two years, we have focused on bringing a new type of content to the supply chain leader. We have published  112 blog posts, 42 reports, 65 podcasts, and 37 webcasts. We have also published two journals and one book. Next year, it continues. We plan to publish 30 reports, 100 podcasts, 15 webcasts, four journals and a new book. It is our goal to create content in the form that meets your needs.</p>
    <p>We are a bootstrap start-up. The team is passionate. We try to take a unique twist to help the supply chain leader think differently. The subject of supply chain can seem boring and old to some, but not to us.  Please let us know how we are doing and how we can do better!</p>
    <p>We love to hear from our readers on how we can make what we do better.</p>
    <p>The Team at Supply Chain Insights</p>
