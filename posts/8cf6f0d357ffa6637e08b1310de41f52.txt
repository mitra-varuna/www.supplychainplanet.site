    <p>The beginning of March also signals the start of preseason exhibition games of Major League Baseball, known as Spring Training, in winter-free Florida and Arizona.&nbsp; March also brings around one of the most famous analytics events: the Sloan/MIT Sports Analytics Conference.&nbsp; When it was first held 10 years ago, nearly all the content focused on baseball. This is understandable; the sport has a special place in the hearts of those inclined towards math and numbers. Children for decades have collected baseball cards, a pocket sized paper database of key statistics of their favorite major league players. The game is easily the most data friendly sport. Businesses would be thrilled to have this level of data capture - hundreds of discrete events per game - and a long history of accurate data, from over 2,000 games a year for over a century. When computing power exploded in the 1990s, it was no surprise that Major League Baseball became the vanguard of analytics in sports.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
