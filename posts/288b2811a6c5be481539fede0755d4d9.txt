    <p></p><p>Starting a company is not easy. It is even more challenging when it is a new business model. This is the story of Supply Chain Insights. We are committed to helping supply chain visionaries gain first-mover advantage through research insights.</p>
    <p>Forging a new direction and building a research model using open content is challenging. We don’t aspire to be consultants and the analyst model is not universally understood, but we will soon be three years old. We have survived our bumps and bruises, and remain committed to serving you, the supply chain leader. It is our goal to be recognized as the primary content provider for supply chain visionaries.</p>
    <p>As the curtain closes on the past year, we celebrate a lot of firsts and a number of wins. In 2014, we launched the Supply Chains to Admire methodology: evolved the Supply Chain Index ( a method to judge supply chain improvement); and launched the Supply Chain Benchmarking methodology. We also published our third book, <em>Metrics that Matter</em> (available on December 22<sup>nd</sup>) and successfully produced our second Global Summit.  In 2015, we will launch our new community, and a simulation activity for group facilitation to help teams better understand outside-in processes.</p>
    <p>As we close the year, our gift to you, the supply chain leader, is the collection of insights embedded in 64 reports from 43 surveys by over 3000 respondents. As you travel during the holidays, take us with you! Either tuck a couple of our reports into your suitcase, put our books in your briefcase, or download our podcasts on your iPhone.  We are committed to help you start the New Year on the right foot!</p>
