    <p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that the MIT SCM program is ranked as <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/masters-supply-chain-management-ranked-number-one-0425">the best supply</a><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/masters-supply-chain-management-ranked-number-one-0425" style="text-align: justify;"> chain program in the world</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> was not the only factor I considered when I decided t</span><span style="text-align: justify;">o apply to the program. Another major aspect was the fact that I could simultaneously complete the </span><a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate" style="text-align: justify;">Sustainability Certificate</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> at MIT Sloan School of Management.</span></p>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">My Passion for Sustainability</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is hard for me to look back and remember when my passion for sustainability started, but it has always been there for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I worried about environmental conservation, and as I grew older I started to ask myself, “How could we create better living and working conditions for people in general?” At the beginning of my career in supply chain, I realized its potential for making a difference in sustainability. So when I decided to apply to grad school, I sought a program that would not only teach me the best tools and practices but also expand my knowledge on the relationships between supply chain and sustainability.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Get the Sustainability Certificate</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to receive the sustainability certificate, students must complete 5 different courses: introduction to system dynamics, sustainability lab, capstone seminar in sustainability and two electives. For sure, it is a lot more work than just doing the regular master’s program, but it is definitely worth it!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All classes discuss sustainability from a holistic perspective considering social, economic and environmental factors. We analyze how different sectors can contribute to a more sustainable world, and our responsibilities as individuals. Several guest speakers talked about their career paths in sustainability, and how they promoted change in their companies. We looked at the businesses that are leaders in sustainability and understood how they got there. In the sustainability lab class, we worked on projects with big companies to improve their sustainable practices. Additionally, I had the chance to meet many students with interests very similar to mine and develop a strong network with people passionate about sustainability. One of the alumni also wrote about his experience in pursuing the Sustainability Certificate, which can be found <a href="https://mitscmprogram.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/why-i-choose-sustainability-in-supply-chain-management/">here</a>.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Now, a week before commencement, I can say for sure that I made the right choice. The master’s in supply chain was an amazing program and the sustainability certificate was the icing on the cake. I have no doubt that supply chain is one of the key areas to bring sustainable practices to businesses. I understand that any company, independent of its size and business model can make a difference. I also now appreciate the impact of our choices as individuals to change business and society. And now, more than ever, I feel prepared to go out and make a difference.</p>
