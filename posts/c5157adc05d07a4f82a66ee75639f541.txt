    <p></p><p>I had a great discussion this week with a supply chain leader on the launch of the training that coincides with the release of <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/research/books/" target="_blank" title="Bricks Matter: The Role of Supply Chains in Building Market-Driven Differentiation"><strong>Bricks Matter</strong> </a>on December 24th, 2012. He was excited.  After reviewing the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/loracecere/ibf-panel-on-future-of-sop" target="_blank" title="see the slide deck on SlideShare">slide deck </a>that I had built for the upcoming IBF conference panel, he wanted to know more about Supply Chain Insights. He loved the slides and the research.</p>
    <p>As we discussed the roll-out of the Bricks Matter training, he decided to include it in his planning for 2013. Like many supply chain leaders, talent development is on the top of his agenda. In his words, &#8220;<em>We started our work on supply chain four years ago without a master plan.  We gathered thought leaders from different organizations and started the journey.  We duked it out.  We fought and pulled our way forward.  I cannot say that we are there yet. The team needs the training.  We need alignment.   Our feet ha</em><em>ve stepped off the curb, but are not ready yet to walk together across the street.&#8221; </em>We are excited about the training.  If you would like more information about it, please contact <a href="mailto:Regina.Denman@supplychaininsights.com">Regina.Denman@supplychaininsights.com</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a big week for the team at Supply Chain Insights. On Wednesday, we get the page proofs back from the publisher. It will be three to four, time consuming days to finalize the layout of the 411 pages.  At the same time, it will be exciting to see the book come together. It will be the first time that I will see the 98,000 words of text with the 72 graphics.  Yowza! The book is on track to publish on December 24th. We have launched a special website for easy tracking of the book, book signings and press mentions and reviews.  Today, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bricks-Matter-Building-Market-Driven-Differentiation/dp/1118218310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349636713&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bricks+matter" target="_blank" title="Preorder Bricks Matter on Amazon">pre-order it on Amazon </a>.</p>

    <p>Research is at the core of what we do. Our fifth monthly newsletter will publish on November 5th. Contained within it will be three new reports. This will make 18 reports we have published at Supply Chain Insights. It is our goal to publish 25 by the end of the year. We will continue to publish the reports using the Open Content research model.</p>
    <p>You can help us to help the industry by filling out surveys.

    <p>So, if your supply chain team has one foot off the curb and are ready to walk across the street to drive excellence in supply chain, we want to be your one-stop resource.<em> </em></p>
