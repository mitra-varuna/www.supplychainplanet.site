    <p>This year, we will publish two new books: <em>Supply Chain Metrics That Matter</em> and <em>The Shaman’s Journal</em>. We are adding these two new books for your bookshelf to stand beside <em>Bricks Matter</em> which published in December, 2012. In 2015, it is our goal to publish another new book, <em>Lessons in Supply Chain Leadership.</em> Each book takes a new twist on the old topic of supply chain excellence. It is our goal to publish meaningful books for the supply chain leadership team. Here is an overview of the different books:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bricks-Matter-Building-Market-Driven-Differentiation/dp/1118218310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408447189&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bricks+matter">Bricks Matter</a></strong></em> published in December, 2012 and is a chronology of 30 years of supply chain progress. We published Bricks Matter on the 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of Supply Chain Management. It is now going to press for its second printing. It is designed for the supply chain team that wants to reflect on the past and look forward to the future.</li>
    <li><em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Supply-Chain-Metrics-Matter-Corporate/dp/1118858115/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408447280&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=metrics+that+matter">Supply Chain Metrics That Matter</a></strong></em> will publish in December 2014. It is a story of a fictional leadership team that uses the Supply Chain Index to determine which metrics matter, how to judge supply chain improvement, and how to gain alignment. The book details what is possible, and at what rate, for metrics improvement based on lessons from leaders. This book is the culmination of a two year research project and gives leaders guidance on what is possible in defining supply chain potential. It is designed to be used by a leadership team to better understand the impact of supply chain excellence on corporate performance. The book can be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Supply-Chain-Metrics-Matter-Corporate/dp/1118858115/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408452345&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Metrics+That+Matter" target="_blank" title="Pre-order Supply Chain Metrics That MAtter from Amazon">pre-ordered from Amazon</a>.</li>
    <li><em><strong>The</strong> <strong>Shaman’s Journal </strong></em>is a collection of the most popular posts from the <a href="http://www.supplychainshaman.com/">Supply Chain Shaman blog.</a> It will be handed out at our Supply Chain Insights Global Summit in Scottsdale, AZ on September 10-11, 2014. The digital and print versions will be available on our website and through Amazon after the conference. It is a self-published paperback book.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Lessons in Supply Chain Leadership</em>. </strong>Using the Supply Chain Index Methodology, and progress on the Effective Frontier, this new book, <em>Lessons in Supply Chain Leadership</em> will be a chronology of interviews of supply chain leaders on operating strategies and business results. Our goal is to publish 50-75 completed case studies. An example of a case study format for this book can be found in the Supply Chain Shaman blog post titled <a href="http://www.supplychainshaman.com/demand/judging-supply-chain-improvement-campbell-soup-case-study/">Judging Supply Chain Improvement: Campbell Soup Case Study.</a>  We are currently talking to publishers and finalizing the editorial calendar. Let us know if you are interested in working with us on this book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Writing a book is easier said than done. For the staff at Supply Chain Insights it is a rallying point, and a compelling event, to solidify thoughts and raise the level of research to the next level. It is grueling and exciting all at the same time. While my name is on the front cover, the content is driven by a team. Each book is a new project with a new set of deadlines. At first, it is easy and fun; but, as the deadlines loom, many, many hours are spent writing, editing, and rewriting while staring out of the same window. It is hard to not get cranky and out-of-sorts.  The editing processes—like an endless root canal—never seems to end. To give perspective, the book <em>Supply Chain Metrics That Matter</em> was written between November 2013 and August 2014 with a cadence of a chapter a month. The book will take five months to edit and publish. In this world of digital media, it is an amazing process to watch; but I look forward to cracking the cover of the first book, and being able to smell the ink. I want to share that moment with you.</p>
    <p>We hope these books find their way to your bookshelf and they help your supply chain thinking. In the end, this is our goal. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
