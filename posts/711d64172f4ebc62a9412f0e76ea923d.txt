    <p style="text-align: justify;">Being in the pioneering SCM Blended class is very exciting! Maybe as exciting as being the very first MM SCM Alumni (<a href="http://www.scmr.com/article/mits_first_micromasters_learners_earn_credentials" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Supply Chain Management Review</a>, <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/first-micromasters-learners-earn-credentials-0620" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MIT News</a>, <a href="http://supplychainmit.com/2017/06/22/micromasters-milestones-first-cohort-finishes-18000-learners-500-years-of-traditional-classes/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3B7NOZ5OcEQc2reXQaV7XHLQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Supply Chain @ MIT</a>). On the other hand, we had to make each of our steps into the darkness – unknown future for us without precedent.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let me share with you some of my experiences. If you will follow the same path, it might be useful. This blog is about the part one of the <a href="http://scm.mit.edu/program/blended-masters-degree-supply-chain-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MIT SCMb</a> AAA logistics problem &#8211; <a href="http://scm.mit.edu/blended-admissions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Application</a>.</p>
    <p>Besides the MM SCM completion, CTL.MIT requires:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Resume</li>
    <li>Proof of an undergraduate/graduate education (all you have)</li>
    <li>Two reference letters</li>
    <li>For international students – IELTS or TOEFL test</li>
    <li>Research project proposal</li>
    <li>Introduction video addressing four (pre-defined) questions</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn’t take long to create a proper <strong><a href="https://gecd.mit.edu/jobs-and-internships/resumes-cvs-cover-letters-and-linkedin/resumes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resume</a></strong> and provide a <strong>proof of education</strong>. However, you really should start working on the other requirements early.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I started to reach out to my former university professor and to key persons in my company 1 year before I applied. Luckily, my professor remembered me and I needed just 2-3 more reminders during the application period to get her <strong>reference letter</strong>. The professional reference letters shouldn’t be a problem. Currently, you don’t need academic reference, as far as I know. But still, talk to senior managers in advance and explain to them your idea. At the right point in time, you can reach out to them for a reference letter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As preparation for my <strong><a href="https://www.ielts.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IELTS</a>,</strong> I remember taking Edx courses in the summer 2016. This course was offered by the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/ielts-academic-test-preparation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University of Queensland</a>. It certainly helped me to get an idea of the style of the exam. Even if you speak well, you might be unprepared for the method of language testing by IELTS. For academic writing test, it is expected, that you know how to structure an essay, how to understand statistical results from charts and tables. The listening test is recorded in various regional dialects such as Irish or Australian way to speak. You shall be able to understand it and to get all information needed to complete the exercises in real time. For reading test, you shall be able to read several papers in a short period of time (60 minutes), understand the essentials and answer a number of specific questions. The speaking test is a recorded fast pace interview e.g. about further education you plan to pursue. In November 2016, I was ready and after 3 hours of paper-based tests and a 15-minute interview, I successfully passed my exam with minimum requirement of 7 points.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The elaboration of the <strong><a href="http://scm.mit.edu/scm-blended-research">research project proposal</a></strong> was much more challenging. For four months, I reached out to various persons in my company before finally catching the attention of the VP Supply Chain Europe. I had to “sell“ my idea and promised to promote the company’s success at MIT. In the following 6 months, I informed her monthly about my progress and provided some research ideas. Don’t expect anybody to give you an idea for research. You have to find your own one and convince the key person to support you. Try to find something feasible with data access because otherwise you will really suffer later in the program (no time!). The research proposal itself must have exactly two pages. I compiled it like a mini-academic research project, with an introduction, research question, relevance, relation to the sponsoring company, and solution proposal. If you want to have a few more insights and experiences from my classmates, please read the <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/documents/12/MIT_Masters_SCM_Students_FInding_Capstone_Projects.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blended research project insights</a>. Our residential classmates had a different experience with capstone or thesis research projects. This part was not one of their application requirements. But the decision making process and the selection of topics might be a similar one. If you are interested, then you definitely should read <a href="https://mitscmprogram.wordpress.com/2018/02/12/capstone-or-thesis-which-will-you-choose/">Lauren’s blog</a>. <a href="http://ctl.mit.edu/pub?keys=&amp;field_publication_date_value%5Bmin%5D=&amp;field_publication_date_value%5Bmax%5D=&amp;type_1%5B%5D=thesis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hier </a>are some of the thesis or capstone project examples. As the last word of advice in regard to your project proposal in cooperation with a sponsoring company, keep in mind that a standard Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) between the sponsoring company and MIT must be signed once the project will start. Many companies propose their own NDAs so the negotiation can take a substantial period of time. Try to clarify these aspects as early as possible.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot7ssg4TdIs&amp;list=PL6RvHHoto58sxRq1GG-gJpgvye8XEjFHc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My video statement</a></strong> was the last of the requirements I worked on. Originally, I planned to spend not more than a few hours on it. I realized later this was the case for some of my peers. Since I wanted to be the best and didn’t know the “competition,“ I tried to differentiate myself. Four different areas should be the stages for the four questions to be addressed. I chose my former university, the place I worked, a park nearby, and a local port. My best friend sacrificed his leisure time for me as cameraman and helped to cut the video. On the end, we spent three days for this requirement instead of one.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I hope I have given you an idea of how to organize your application. Everyone has her/his own way. All I want to stress is: don’t wait too long on the preparations for the application. You can be surprised by the amount of time you will invest in it.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I earned my first master’s degree in Master of Business Management at the University of Mannheim focusing on marketing but was lucky to start my carrier in logistics. I have worked in heavy industry for Alstom and GE as supply chain manager and I am passionate about solving customized strategic problems. After completion of my second master of Engineering in SCM at MIT, I plan to dive into more analytical field of supply chain management. Outside of the classroom and office, I enjoy to go scuba diving, running half-marathons and drawing portraits. </em></p>
