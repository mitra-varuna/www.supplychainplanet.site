    <p></p><p>February marks two years. Supply Chain Insights, as a company, is maturing.  In 2013 we have almost doubled revenue and tripled reach. Today we will publish our 17<sup>th</sup> newsletter to over 7000 supply chain professionals. We love content. This year we have published 25 reports, completed more than 55 podcasts, archived more than 20 webcasts, conducted our fifth public training session and hosted our first, and what will become, our annual event.</p>
    <p>Leading a bootstrap startup effort is not easy. Blazing a new trail with a new business model is tough. My family thinks that I am crazy; but, the new model is working.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, two strangers walked up and introduced themselves to me. I was tired. It was one of those days where I just wanted to crawl under a rock and rest. It is my fourth week of tough travel, and I am busy on my second manuscript. However, they were fans of the Supply Chain Shaman blog. They wanted to meet Lora Cecere. I smiled. We sat and talked. A new handshake with an appreciative reader makes it all worthwhile.</p>
    <p>Each applauded me for straight talk in a market that is exploding with confusing geek speak. I don’t take accolades well. My goal is to simply make  the supply chain leader&#8217;s life easier, and to help companies be more productive. This is our mission at Supply Chain Insights. It takes a team. I am proud of the work that we are doing. I give thanks for client support. Thanks for helping me to live my dream.</p>
