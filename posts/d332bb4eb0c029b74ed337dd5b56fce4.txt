    <p></p><p>On September 9–11, 2014, 110 supply chain visionaries will gather in the desert at the Phoenician Hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona to think differently and define the future of supply chain. It is needed. Today, 90% of publicly-traded companies are stuck at the intersection of operating margin and inventory turns. While most companies have been able to make progress in one of these two critical metrics in the period of 2006-2013, they have not been able to make progress on both together. With slowing growth, and the need to become more competitive, the pressure is on. Supply chain teams are being asked to do more with less. It is time to unstick the supply chain by redefining processes, adopting new technologies, and embracing disruption.</p>
    <p>What is disruption? Here are five examples that will be discussed at the conference.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Digital Printing. </strong>Redefining the Maintenance Repair and Operating Spares Market. Digital printing can now be used to print spare parts on demand. Will your UPS store or Third-party Logistics (3PL) provider, through printing on-demand, become the new provider of parts for industrial equipment? Will spare-parts store rooms become obsolete? Gain new perspective at the Global Summit.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation of Supply Chain Execution. </strong>Will wearables, voice, internet of things, and robotics redefine warehouse management to reduce costs to pick goods by 30-40%? When will manless vehicles, enabling the delivery of goods and services without the restrictions of labor laws, become mainstream? Think about it first at the Supply Chain Insights Global Summit.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive Learning Systems.</strong> Supply chains do not play by the rules, but our systems are hard-coded with inflexible rules. We all know that events happen, and teams need greater agility in processes and technology. Will rules-based ontologies and learning systems help systems to adapt as supply chains shift? We think so.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborative Economy. </strong>Can sharing redefine go-to-market strategies? How can companies adapt to embrace the collaborative economy? Explore these alternatives at the Global Summit. Challenge your thinking.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainable Products. </strong>Traditional supply chains produce products while the supply chains of the future will support the design of products from cradle to grave. When will demanufacturing and remanufacuturing—to enable the capture and reuse of materials—become mainstream? Gain new insights.</li>
