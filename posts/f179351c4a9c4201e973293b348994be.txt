    <p>The late, great ex-Beatle, George Harrison, once write a song entitled, “If You Don’t Know Where You’re Goin’, Any Road Will Take You There.”  Really, George?</p>
    <p>In the often-maddening world of trade promotion, the road to <em>real</em> ROI is not so easily marked; and when you <em>do</em> get there, you may not know where you are.  It’s more like Buckaroo Bonzai’s profound uttering, “No matter where you go, there you are.”  Either way, what <em>DO</em> you get out of it?</p>
    <p>There are research reports, white papers and even YouTube videos galore on the topic of ROI for trade promotion.  <a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_109214855_orig.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9535 alignright" height="215" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_109214855_orig-300x215.jpg" width="300" /></a>Many of the current trade promotion solutions provide analytical tools and optimization engines that deliver “ROI” results from an array of different combinations of promotional tactics.  Only a few, however, define ROI. Doing the research for this post, I looked at several reports published over the years that graphically rendered a variety of ROI results; but it was often depicted as a single value.</p>
    <p>If I were an account director managing a huge national big box retailer for a major consumer electronics supplier and I told my boss that our trade promotion spending last quarter generated a 35% ROI, I must hope he does not ask me what made up the incremental value. Chances are good that I would not be able to break it down for him. When he goes to a department heads meeting the next day and reports that trade promotion spending for this account yielded a net 35% ROI, he may be shocked when the CMO tells him that overall market share for the retailer dropped 50% in that same period. He may also be on the hot seat if the CFO or CEO asks him to break down that 35% ROI figure.</p>
    <p>Clearly, a huge percentage of sales people who are asked that question will reply that it was a factor of the incremental volume of product sold because of the commitment or spending of trade funds (that end up deducted from the next invoice). Fortunately, however, thanks to the technology innovation being brought to the market in the form of more sophisticated predictive and post promotion analytics, we can now begin to measure the specific make-up of the “ROI” reported.</p>
    <p>The above scenario plays out all too often. The relative importance of ROI for trade spending is a top priority; but why, then is there so little attention paid to exactly <em>what</em> the ROI is? Is the disconnect because there are two separate organizations &#8211; sales and marketing &#8211;  with different (and often competing) goals and no regular communication between each other? Or can it be that the ultimate prize, the consumer’s loyalty, does not drive the planning and execution of either? Actually, marketing organizations clearly do a better job of that; but not using the trade funds to support and accelerate the ultimate objective continues to be a dangerous and risky oversight.</p>
    <p>After spending the past five years working with the world’s largest retailers and contributing to the design and development of retail software applications, it is clear to me that they too must address the joint retailer-supplier ROI issue. Generally, it is my observation that they have more sophistication in their trade promotion optimization technology than the suppliers do; and of course, they have the extremely important benefit of owning customer loyalty data that, for the most part, is not shared with their suppliers.  In other words, they do a better job of knowing which road to take to get to where they want to go.</p>
    <p>With a robust c<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_182719682_600.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-9533 alignleft" height="164" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_182719682_600-300x225.jpg" width="219" /></a>onsumer profile database and highly intelligent consumer online shopping tracking tools, they have a clear edge in being able to build a more accurate targeting plan for trade promotion that aligns to their own corporate marketing campaigns and events, and better predicts the ultimate ROI.  This figure will be broken down into component values like incremental customer spending (POS), in-store traffic patterns, online research and purchasing, consumer brand preferences and more.</p>
    <p>Even if some amount of this intelligence is share with the supplier (category captains often have some access to this data to assist in category planning), this will not help the CSO to respond to the CMO’s charge that a positive ROI in trade promotion does not play nice with a 50% drop in share.  So how does he respond?</p>
    <p>He should take the offense. His response should be to use that very data point to engage in a deeper collaboration between sales and marketing. Sales will continue to use trade promotion as the primary incentive to generate sales volume; but the retailers understand the need to align the trade channel promotion activities with the corporate marketing campaigns and events, and are likely to welcome a better collaboration that produces a smarter promotion and a true incentive package to drive the shopper into the store instead of the internet.</p>
    <p>The trade promotion vendors are beginning to create solutions that accommodate the future need to align marketing and sales.  In Kantar Retail’s 2016 Study on Trade Promotion, Brad Golden, Vice President, Consulting stated, “What the study clearly shows is that the industry knows the shopper remains boss. In an increasingly omni-channel world, both manufacturers and retailers believe the shopper will continue gaining power. However, more work is needed to understand how trade promotions affect shopper behavior longer-term.”</p>
    <p>Amen, Brad.</p>
    <p>There are two tracks of action items for manufacturers here. The first is for both the sales and marketing organizations to work together, break down the wall that exists today, and begin collaborating across a <em>single integrated trade calendar.</em>  Align your trade promotions to the marketing campaigns and events.  Oh, and by the way, SHARE the consumer data so that what you plan in trade promotion fits nicely with the direct-to-consumer plans.  Second, provide this consolidated intelligence to your buyer, marketing and merchandising teams at the retailer. Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate.<a href="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_102000967_orig.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9534 alignright" height="200" src="http://supplychaininsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_102000967_orig-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>
    <p>Sorry George, but any road you take will <em>not </em>get you there. Take these two action items, and the road you do take will always get you there.  And a high, defend-able ROI is what you get outa this.</p>
