    <p>What do you get when you blend flavors from 17 countries with 42 exceptional individuals with a combined experience of 20 Decades?Â  &#8211; SCMr Class of 2019</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">MIT SCMr CO2019 welcomes you to join us in our roller coaster ride this year. It seems like it was only yesterday when strangers from all walks of life met at a local pub to finally meet their fellow classmates with whom they had been conversing for the past few months over online chats.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Our orientation began in August with the quintessential Beer Game and the fun team bonding trip to Â beautiful Thompson Island. What followed next was the two weeks of craziness where we juggled between classes, outings, networking events, capstone project bidding, and exams (YES! You read it right: we had our first exam at MIT in our first 2 weeks).</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Now three months into this fun place that we now call home, we cannot wait to start sharing our stories of learning, friendships, celebrations, networking madness, recruitments and all things MIT. We have been learning a lot from each other about our experiences, diverse cultures and perspectives. Beauty in diversity is one of the highlights of our class and we believe that the richness of our experiences is only getting better as we join hands and work towards enhancing the supply chains of the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">As we write this blog, the beautiful fall colors have embraced Cambridge and we have embraced the stillness in chaos ( almost <img alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Gear up to read about our graduate life from a versatile cohort of students including volcano climbers, military veterans, ski champions, analytics ninjas, fitness freaks, and more. We are absolutely looking forward to explore what is in store for us in the coming months and we hope to show you a glimpse of this program through our stories.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned <img alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
